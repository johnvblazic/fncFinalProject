{'Stance': 'agree', 'Body ID': 1318, 'Headline': 'CPWD official sacked for absence from duty for 25 years'} | discuss | agree | (Reuters) - Even in India, where government jobs are considered to be for life, A.K. Verma was pushing it.

Verma, an executive engineer at the Central Public Works Department, was fired after last appearing for work in December 1990.

"He went on seeking extension of leave, which was not sanctioned, and defied directions to report to work," the government said in a statement on Thursday.

Even after an inquiry found him guilty of "wilful absence from duty" in 1992, it took another 22 years and the intervention of a cabinet minister to remove him, the government said.

India's labour laws, which the World Bank says are the most restrictive anywhere, make it hard to sack staff for any reason other than criminal misconduct.

States, led by Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, have recently changed the law to make it easier to hire and fire staff, in a move welcomed by industry leaders but opposed by labour unions.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cracked down on rampant absenteeism by making New Delhi bureaucrats sign in at work using a fingerprint scanner. The results are publicly available online - at www.attendance.gov.in - in real time.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 324, 'Headline': 'Bodies In Mexico Mass Grave Apparently Not Those Of Missing Students'} | discuss | unrelated | Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is pushing back against a claim made by Rep. Duncan Hunter that at least 10 Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant fighters were apprehended trying to come into the U.S. from Mexico.

“We have no credible, specific intelligence to that effect,” Johnson said of ISIL insurgents illegally entering the country from along the southern border on CNN Wednesday evening. “And I look at the intelligence reports from overseas from our southern border from our intelligence community virtually every day, numerous times a day, to be on the lookout for something of that nature. So, what I’d say to the American public is we’re vigilant in looking out for individuals of suspicion who may be crossing our border.”

The top DHS official didn’t mention Hunter, a California Republican congressman, by name. But on several occasions, Johnson said that public officials have a “responsibility” to not “unnecessarily frighten the American public.”

“Let’s not unduly create fear and anxiety in the American public by passing on speculation and rumor,” the secretary told host Wolf Blitzer.

Blitzer asked specifically about comments made Tuesday evening by Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee. “[A]t least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” the congressman said during an interview on Fox News, citing information from source from Customs and Border Protection, which is under DHS authority. Hunter also suggested that it was likely that “dozens” of others linked to the terrorist group that has recently beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers would likely not get caught by border agents and make their way into the U.S.

On Wednesday, DHS flatly said that Hunter’s claim was unfounded. “The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesperson said.

Judicial Watch reported later Wednesday that four “Islamic terrorists” had been seized along the southern border in 36 hours.

Hunter’s deputy chief of staff, Joe Kasper, told POLITICO that the congressman stands by his statement, which came from a conversation with a “high-level” source, but didn’t elaborate when asked about the individuals’ specific ties to ISIL.

In September, Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah claimed that four men linked to terrorist organizations tried to cross the border earlier that month.
{'Stance': 'agree', 'Body ID': 2475, 'Headline': 'Nicaragua Meteorite Impact Theory May Be Meteor-wrong'} | unrelated | agree | We reported on Monday that a meteor, thought possibly to be a chunk of an Earth-passing asteroid, was the cause of a 40-foot crater outside the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital.

But astronomers and NASA scientists are now casting doubt on that possibility. The biggest mystery is that no one so far has reported seeing a flash of light in the sky that would be expected to accompany such a meteor strike.

"While a meteoritic origin for this crater cannot be ruled out with absolute certainty, the information available at this time suggests that some other cause is responsible for its creation," NASA's blog concludes.

Space.com reports:

It's a sentiment echoed by Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to Nicaragua's Institute of Territorial Studies, or Ineter, who concluded that it's "very strange that no one reported a streak of light.

"We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something," he said.

It also appears that a meteor landing in Nicaragua could not have come from asteroid 2014 RC, also nicknamed "Pitbull," as first thought. National Geographic writes:

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 1097, 'Headline': 'Dumped woman spends a week in KFC to get over ex'} | discuss | unrelated | Islamic State has released a video showing the beheading of British hostage David Haines.

It comes just hours after his family issued a public plea for his captors to contact them.

The Foreign Office said it was "working urgently to verify" the video and offering Mr Haines's family support.

David Cameron, the Prime Minister, said: "The murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude."

He added: "We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes."

Mr Haines, 44, was kidnapped last year as he delivered humanitarian aid in Syria.

His whereabouts were only revealed this month when he was shown kneeling in the sand, wearing an orange jumpsuit, in a video produced by jihadists of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) which also showed the murder of Steven Sotloff, an American journalist.

A masked man, who has become known as “Jihadi John”, said Mr Haines would be next if the West did not halt operations against Isil.

In the latest video, he is also wearing a orange jumpsuit and is kneeling on the sand.

It begins with a clip from David Cameron. A man believed to be Mr Haines then looks into the camera and says: "My name is David Cawthorne Haines. I would like to delcare that I hold you David Cameron entirely responsible for my execution.

"You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State just as your predecessor Tony Blair did, following a trend against our British prime ministers who can't find the courage to say no to the Americans.

"Unfortunately it is we the British public that in the end will pay the price for our Parliament's selfish decisions."

Twitter: David Cameron - The murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude.

Twitter: David Cameron - We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.

In a statement, the Foreign and Commonwealth said: "We are aware of the video.

"We are working urgently to verify the content. If true, this is another disgusting murder. We are offering the family every support possible.

"They have asked to be left alone at this time."

Mr Cameron rushed back to Downing Street for crisis talks with his advisers, officials and intelligence chiefs on Saturday night. He arrived at No 10 just after midnight.

He chaired a COBRA meeting on Sunday morning.

In the Haines family’s short statement - which was released earlier on Saturday by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office - the British captive’s relatives said: “We are the family of David Haines.

“We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply.We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

No further details of their messages were released.

Mr Haines had worked for aid agencies in some of the world’s worst trouble spots, including Libya and South Sudan.

He was travelling in a car through northern Syria in March last year when he was abducted along with an Italian colleague, who was later released. He was working for a French aid organisation, Agency for Technical Co-operation and Development (Acted).

Mr Haines is believed to have been kidnapped by a gang which later sold him on to Isil.

His identity remained a closely guarded secret for 19 months in a bid to increase the chances of a negotiated release.

But the situation changed dramatically with the execution first of James Foley, another American journalist, and then Mr Sotloff with the subsequent appearance of Mr Haines in the second murder video.

MPs reacted with horror and anger to the reports on Saturday night.

Ed Vaizey, a government minister and Conservative MP, said he was “so sad and angry” to hear reports of Mr Haines’s murder.

Stella Creasy, a Labour MP and shadow minister, said she was “shocked and horrified” to see reports that Mr Haines had been killed. “Hoping mistaken but fear not,” she said.

Dan Jarvis, another senior Labour MP, said he was “sickened”.

Tim Farron, President of the Liberal Democrats, said: “My thoughts and prayers are with David Haines' family and friends tonight.”

Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said: “I am sickened at the disgusting, barbaric killing of David Haines.

“He was somebody whose only purpose was to help innocent people, themselves victims of conflict.

“That ISIL would choose to kill him says everything about their warped logic and murderous ways.

“Acts like this will not weaken but strengthen the resolve of Britain and the international community to defeat ISIL and their ideology.

“My deepest condolences and thoughts are with his family as they cope with this terrible crime. And the hearts of the British people will go out to them.”

Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said the UK should respond by playing its role in the assault against IS promised by US president Barack Obama.

"What we absolutely need to do is not be cowed in any way by yet another foul murder of a hostage," he told Sky News.

"But to develop the strategy into a sensible military campaign in coalition with regional players such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries in the area.

"We can support them to confront, attack and defeat the Islamic State jihadi fighters ... and make sure this cancer is removed from the region before it spreads more widely."

The United States also "strongly condemned" the killing.

In a statement, the White House said: "Our hearts go out to the family of Mr Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom. The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve.

"We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world."

According to a report from UK publication The Mirror, the group’s famed lead singer Robert Plant literally tore up a contract to reunite the band worth almost $800 million, saying the timing just wasn’t right for a reunion tour.

Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin brand fame was apparently behind the entire thing, offering the band an obscene amount of money just to reunite for a few dozen shows. The contract was reportedly for 35 shows in three cities: London, Berlin, and an unnamed location in New Jersey. Each of the three remaining original members would have earned somewhere over $200 million each just for performing, while another $100 million in merchandising profits was to be shared between the group members.

English: Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin

Branson was reportedly also ready to supply the group with their own private jet for the tour. The mogul was prepared to take one of his airline’s planes and rebrand it “The Starship”. The contract also had an extension option to add 45 more shows in additional venues should the band agree.

The other two original members of the group apparently signed on immediately, and Jason Bonham, the son of late drummer John Bonham, was set to step in for his father. Plant apparently met with conert promoters to discuss the deal, and during the meeting actually ripped the contract in two, ending any chance of a regrouping.


While $800 million is certainly a lot of money, it’s not like Robert Plant (or any of the other members for that matter) really need it. Led Zeppelin are one of the most successful groups of all time, having sold around 112 million records in the United States alone (that figure is three or four times that when the entire planet is counted). In fact, they are the fourth best-selling music act in American history, right behind The Beatles, Elvis Presley, and Garth Brooks.

Robert Plant has also had an incredibly successful career outside of Led Zeppelin. He has released fourteen albums, selling additional millions and making his chart history that much more impressive. His collaborative album Raising Sand with bluegrass/country singer Alison Krauss may not have been his most commercially successful, but it was adored universally by critics, and won he, Alison, and producer T-Bone Burnett five Grammys back in 2009, including Record of the Year and Album of the Year.

While the band’s last album of original music, Coda, was released back in 1982, the band has continued to sell well throughout the years, making millions in repackagings, reissues and live album releases. The group’s last show together was in London back in December of 2007, which was a tribute to legendary music executive Ahmet Ertegün. The concert is thought to have had the most-desired tickets of any show in history, as when it was announced, 20 million requests were submitted online for passes.

With all the bad news coming out of Syria, Iraq, and the Ukraine, it’s easy to forget that the United States still has thousands of troops on the ground in Afghanistan. While a new combat theater has opened up in the Levant, the fight to vanquish the Taliban and the remnants of the Afghan insurgency rolls on as the longest war in American history finally winds down.

Just last year, one Marine team was conducting a “joint helicopter raid” in Helmand Province when they crossed the sights of a Taliban sniper. The phrase “my life flashed before my eyes” has been used and abused in our culture, but when one of these men kneels down to inspect the hole in his Kevlar helmet, he embodies that feeling.

Almost as striking as the moment itself is the sheer desolation of this land we’ve fought tooth and nail to control for 13 years.

Tokyo: Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumours ranging from a stroke to a coup d'etat, is apparently just recovering from ankle surgery.

Mr Kim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.

"I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended," the source said, adding that the leader had had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.

Such is the fascination with North Korea, the world's most impenetrable country, that rumours spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.

Nevertheless, it is true that Mr Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong-il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, causing speculation about his health.

But the gossip mill started up again last week when Mr Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since September 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. The rumours went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the "Great Successor" was in an "indisposed condition".

"Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people," said the narrator of a documentary called Improving the Lives of the People, showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month.

Outside commentators have guessed that Mr Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.

Weibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice-marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China's official papers, ran a commentary on Monday titled: "For those who make up rumours of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?"

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 639, 'Headline': 'BREAKING UDPATED: ISIS REPORTEDLY USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN KOBANE'} | discuss | unrelated | The World Health Organization is looking into reports that ISIS fighters in Iraq have been showing up at hospitals with Ebola symptoms.

According to the pro-government Iraqi newspaper al Sabaah, an unknown number of ISIS militants have shown up at a hospital in the militant-controlled city of Mosul, about 250 miles north of Baghdad. The paper reported that foreign terrorists brought the disease into Mosul from “several countries” in Africa. (RELATED: ISIS Massacred Every Man And Boy Over 15 In Muslim Town)

It’s not yet clear whether the ISIS extremists actually have Ebola or another disease. Ebola symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and unexplained bleeding and bruising — problems which could also be attributed to malaria or yellow fever. And doctors in Mosul might be unable to even test for Ebola.

WHO spokeswoman Christy Feig said the organization is reaching out to officials in the ISIS-held area to offer help if the disease does turn out to be Ebola. However, United Nations workers are not allowed to work in ISIS-controlled areas in either Iraq or Syria, so a UN operation to help either ISIS militants or any civilians in the areas who contract Ebola is unlikely.

Feig told Mashable that there’s been no official notification from the Iraqi government that the terrorists’ disease is, in fact, Ebola.

ISIS is against western science and medicine as a rule, but apparently several militants have taken to hospitals with Ebola-like symptoms anyway. Since taking control of Mosul in June 2014, ISIS has taken to executing doctors that refuse to treat them.

Kurdish news website Rudaw reported in Nov. 2014 that ISIS executed six doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded fighters, in addition to kidnapping six merchants for failing to pay a monthly tax to ISIS. The group reportedly executed two more doctors just last week.

The U.S. has been hitting ISIS with air strikes since mid-November and the Pentagon confirmed in December that the strikes have killed around 1,000 fighters, including three senior ISIS officials.

An Ebola outbreak, however unlikely, probably wouldn’t help matters much.

As the anchor said, social media, as well as a few news websites, owes meteorologist Mike Seidel an “apology” after some “wild misinformation” circulated about what he was doing during a live appearance with Lester Holt over the weekend.

Williams explained that Seidel has lost communication with the NBC station and couldn’t hear Holt through his earpiece so he turned his back to the camera, took off his gloves and redialed his phone to connect for the segment.

“That’s when the rumors hit the web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow,” Williams said. “It was just Mike working to make it right, which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel.”

But, of course, that explanation is far less hilarious and would likely generate almost zero clicks.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 2149, 'Headline': 'Accountant Claims Comcast Got Him Fired From His Job for Reporting a Customer Service Issue'} | discuss | unrelated | Newly released audio allegedly records the moment that Officer Darren Wilson opened fire on unarmed Michael Brown

At least ten shots can be heard - in two separate volleys of gunfire

Experts have said this indicated a 'moment of contemplation' for Wilson

FBI has confirmed it has interviewed the man who recorded audio

Is another tantalizing piece of evidence collected in the ongoing case

Officer Wilson claims he felt his life was threatened on August 9

Witnesses and a friend of Brown, 18, claim he had surrendered

Brown was buried on Monday in a ceremony attended by thousands

The FBI has been handed a potentially crucial recording that allegedly contains audio of the moment that Officer Darren Wilson opened fire and killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.

Revealed by CNN's Don Lemon on Monday, at least ten shots are heard to ring out during the background of the recording, with a brief but significant pause between the first seven shots and the last volley of four.

The unidentified man who has given the unverified tape to authorities claims to have coincidentally recorded the fatal shots that killed Brown in broad daylight on August 9, and experts who have listened to the audio have said it could prove damning for Officer Wilson.

Scroll Down for Audio

Attorney: Lopa Blumenthal is legally representing the man who claims to have coincidentally recorded the shooting of Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9

'There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern,' said retired Chief Deputy US Marshall Matthew Fog after listening on CNN.

'It is very significant, because if you have a pause there it means somebody had time to think and then fire again.'

In the audio, the unidentified man is heard telling someone, 'You’re so pretty' then 11 gunshots can be heard to cackle in the background — seven in one volley, followed a pause and then a final burst of four.

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.

'He was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat,' said Blumenthal.

'He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.'

Lemon cautioned that 'CNN cannot independent verify the authenticity of this tape' but did say that the FBI have interviewed both Blumenthal and her client.

'We had been told that at least six shots were fired at Michael Brown. In the tape that you have, which is alleged to be of the shooting—we can't independently authorize it, as CNN, because we did not shoot it, but there were more than six shots,' Lemon said.

Nightly scenes of unrest have erupted in Ferguson since Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, more than two weeks ago

Officer Darren Wilson (right, collecting a commendation) has claimed that a confrontation sparked by a scuffle with Michael Brown led to the Ferguson teens fatal shooting on August 9 (left, Wilson paces around the body of Brown in the aftermath of the shooting) while witnesses claim the officer continued to shoot at an unarmed man with his hands up who had surrendered

Grief: Dorian Johnson, who is one of the key witnesses in the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, leaves Brown's funeral at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, on Monday, 25, August

If indeed the audio is genuine it calls into question the version of events that Officer Wilson and the Ferguson police force have claimed occurred on that Saturday afternoon.

At least two autopsies performed on Michael Brown have concluded he died after being shot six times by Wilson after being pulled over by the officer, including a fatal 'kill shot' to the top of his head.

Numerous witnesses, including Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, claim that Wilson opened fire after bungling opening his squad car door, causing the teen to run before turning back to face the officer with his hands raised saying 'don't shoot'.

Johnson then alleges that Wilson continued to fire.

Ferguson police and friends of Officer Wilson contend that Brown engaged in a scuffle with Wilson when the officer pulled him and Johnson over, tried to grab his weapon and then run towards him, leaving him no choice but to fire.

Indeed in recent days reports had emerged stating that Wilson, 28, was badly beaten and left with serious facial injuries following the fatal shooting in the St Louis suburb, including an eye socket fracture.

On Tuesday, The Gateway Pundit reported that the officer had suffered an 'orbital blowout fracture'.

But CNN reported on Thursday that although the officer was taken to a hospital with a badly swollen face following the shooting on August 9, x-rays came back negative for any serious injury.

Earlier reports had claimed that the officer was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows, according to the source.

A police source told Fox: 'The Assistant (Police) Chief took him to the hospital, his face all swollen on one side. He was beaten very severely.'

Demonstrators protest the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last Thursday night

The source continued: 'They ignored him [Wilson] and the officer started to get out of the car to tell them to move. They shoved him right back in, that’s when Michael Brown leans in and starts beating Officer Wilson in the head and the face.'

A police source has confirmed to MailOnline that Wilson was taken to hospital and treated for facial injuries sustained during the Brown incident but would not elaborate on the severity or nature of those injuries.

Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries.

Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime.

He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him.

Wilson is 'traumatized, scared for his life and his family' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury, which met for the first time on Wednesday, will make an example out of him, the source told Fox.

Earlier reports had claimed that Officer Wilson was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has come under fire after calling for the 'vigorous prosecution' of Wilson despite the fact that the officer has not yet been charged with any crime.

His deputy, Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder said: 'It's really heartbreaking to see a man elected to an office that high in our state government... come out with a statement like that, that does prejudge the case.'

St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said on Wednesday he estimated it would be the middle of October before the grand jury reached a decision on whether Officer Wilson will face charges over Michael Brown's death.

Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday ordered the Missouri National Guard to begin withdrawing from Ferguson.

Since the guard's arrival Monday, flare-ups in the small section of town that had been the center of nightly unrest have begun to subside.

About 100 people gathered Thursday evening, walking in laps near the spot where Michael Brown was shot. Some were in organized groups, such as clergy members.

More signs reflected calls by protesters to remove the prosecutor from the case.

The officials say Zehaf-Bibeau is a Canadian born in 1982.

There is at least one other suspect at large, Little reported.

Ottawa police spokesman Chuck Benoit told CBS said two or three gunmen may have been involved.

No motive has been identified for the attacks, although some are linking them to an incident on Monday.

2 dead in shooting attack at Canada’s Parliament

OTTAWA, Ontario—A Canadian soldier standing guard at a war memorial in the country’s capital was shot to death Wednesday, and heavy gunfire then erupted inside Parliament. One gunman was killed, and police said they were hunting for as many as two others.

The bloodshed immediately raised the specter of a coordinated terrorist attack, with Canada already on alert because of a deadly hit-and-run earlier in the week against two Canadian soldiers by a man who police say was fired up with radical Muslim fervor.

Witnesses said the soldier was gunned down at point-blank range by a man carrying a rifle and dressed all in black, with a scarf over his face. They said the gunman then ran off and entered Parliament, a few hundred yards away, where dozens of shots soon rang out.

People fled the complex by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, while others took cover inside as police with rifles and body armor took up positions outside and cordoned off the normally bustling streets around Parliament.

Police gave no details on how the gunman died. But on Twitter, Member of Parliament Craig Scott credited Parliament sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers with shooting the attacker just outside the MPs’ caucus rooms.

Ottawa police spokesman Chuck Benoit said two or three gunmen were believed to be involved in the attacks.

Gilles Michaud, assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, called it a “dynamic, unfolding situation.”

Ottawa Hospital said it received two patients, both listed in stable condition, in addition to the soldier.

“Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said. He said it was a tragedy with “origins as yet not fully known, causes not yet fully understood.”

In Washington, President Barack Obama condemned the shootings as “outrageous,” and in a telephone call with the prime minister, offered U.S. help and reassurance of the American people’s solidarity with Canada.

The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa was locked down as a precaution, and security was tightened at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington.

Tony Zobl said he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor window directly above the National War Memorial, a 70-foot, arched granite cenotaph, or tomb, with bronze sculptures commemorating World War I.

“I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice,” Zobl told the Canadian Press news agency.

“The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.”

Zobl said the gunman then ran up the street toward Parliament Hill.

Cabinet minister Tony Clement tweeted that at least 30 shots were heard inside Parliament, where Conservative and Liberal MPs were holding their weekly caucus meetings.

“I’m safe locked in a office awaiting security,” Kyle Seeback, another member of Parliament, tweeted.

The top spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Harper was safe and had left Parliament Hill.

Breaking News: Macaulay Culkin Found Dead at Age 34

Origins: On 6 November 2014, an online rumor claimed actor Macaulay Culkin, best known for his roles in the 1990s Home Alone films, had died. That rumor was based on a Facebook hoax memorial page set up for the star:

At about 11 a.m. ET on Thursday (November 06, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away.

Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.

The Facebook page memorializing the still-living star was soon taken down, but not before hundreds of thousands of social network users were duped by its claims. Culkin was photographed after the rumor began to circulate, alive and in the company of his bandmates:

A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.
Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.

“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.

The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, made a public statement this morning stating that Father O’neal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isn’t a female.

$72 million richer, to be precise. 

Islam, the son of Bengali immigrants from Queens, is the president of the school's Investment Club and has been profiled by Business Insider for his financial acumen. Mo, as he's known, won't disclose his full net worth but says it's in "the high eight figures." 




Mo's got an apartment in Midtown Manhattan, though his parents won't let him move out of their house until he's 18. He bought a BMW, but he doesn't have a license to drive it – his dad drives him on inspirational tours past the home of his idol, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, a hedge-funder and private asset manager who's ranked the 108th richest American, according to Forbes. 

Islam recalls that, when he first experimented with penny stocks (at the tender age of 9), he lost some of the money he'd saved up from tutoring, which caused him to swear off trading briefly. But he was reinvigorated by Jones's story and quotes his idol: "You learn more from your losses than from your gains." 

From all appearances, Islam's learned plenty.

There’s several pieces of the news, with some indicating that the dictator Jong-Un may no longer be in control of the country.

Jang Jin-sung, formerly a key member of Kim Jong-il’s propaganda machine, said recently that a powerful group of officials that once reported only to Jong-il have stopped taking orders from Jong-Un and now effectively run the country.

The group is called the Organization and Guidance Department, and some of them want to keep the status quo while others want to open up the market.

“On one hand, it’s people who want to maintain a regime monopoly,” Jang told VICE News through a translator.

“On the other hand, it’s not like people are fighting against the regime, but in a policy sense they want to take advantage to get influence. It’s not actually consciously civil war, but there are these two incompatible forces at play.”

The insight comes as Seoul-based think tank North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity says that Kim Yo Jong may be leading the country instead of her brother.

The NKIS says that Jong-Un is getting medical treatment for an unspecified illness, and that the extended treatment was actually decided upon at a high-level meeting in early September that was held at Yo Jong’s suggestion.

She’s now charged with handling important government decisions in his absence, according to the Diplomat, citing the report.

“All the important matters related to government administration should be reported to Kim Yo-jong, so that Kim Jong-un can concentrate on getting better,” the people at the meeting decided.

Yo Jong is the daughter of Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, and his wife Kim Yong-hui, and was first spotted in public in September 2010. She was officially mentioned for the first time on March 9, 2014, being identified as a “senior official” in the government.

Then again, perhaps Yo Kong is not in total control, according to Kim Heung-gwang, the head of NKIS.

“Some say Hwang Byong-so, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,” he said.

The possible leadership change comes amid reports of an attempted coup.

According to an attorney for an unidentified man who lives in an apartment building near the site of the shooting, the recording captures as many as 11 shots fired in the Aug. 9 incident.

The audio, which was played on CNN Monday night, could not immediately be verified by The Washington Post. But a burst of gunfire can be heard (six shots), followed by a pause, and then several more shots (at least four).

“He was in his apartment, he was talking to a friend on a video chat, he heard loud noises and at the moment — at the time he didn’t realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,” the man’s lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, said in an interview with CNN’s Don Lemon. “It just happened to capture 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.”

According to Blumenthal, FBI agents came to her office on Monday to interview the man about the recording.

The 12 second-audio clip is the only using a cell-phone app that only records short excerpts of a video conversation. It captured nothing before the shots began and nothing after. The man, who would like to remain anonymous, has asked that the accompanying video not be shown, Blumenthal said in an interview with The Post.

She first learned of the audio clip through the man’s roommate, who is a former client, and she urged him to share it with authorities.

“He was there when the event happened,” Blumenthal said, adding that he initially assumed the noise was fireworks not gunshots. “He is a very private person and he his not seeking publicity of any kind whatsoever. He was even unaware that this tape was relevant to anyone.”

Neither Ferguson nor St. Louis County police have contacted the man or Blumenthal about the video. After interviewing him on Monday, she said the FBI indicated that they planned to speak with him again on Tuesday.

Autopsy reports conducted by St. Louis County and by the Brown family found that Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

Now rumors suggest that the gold and stainless steel editions of the Apple Watch may set consumers back by $5,000 and $500, respectively!

Apple revealed that it would release three collections - Sport Collection, Watch Collection and Edition Collection, which would be composed of aluminum, stainless steel and gold cases, respectively. It was anticipated that the company would have three basic price points, which would vary depending on the band choice and perhaps size.

Now, according to French website iGen.fr, the stainless steel version of the Apple Watch will start at $500, whereas the gold variant of the wearable may start from $4000 to $5000.

"Apple Watch Stainless Steel (polished or black sidereal) would be proposed at $ 500. The Edition model in yellow or pink gold would be sold between $4,000 and $ 5,000 (translated)," reveals iGen.fr.

The French website cites reliable sources as the basis of its information. iGen.fr has a track record of being dependable as the publication reported the dimensions of the then impending iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6 smartphones from Apple correctly.

Previous estimates from industry experts have pegged the top-end gold Apple Watch's pricing between $1000 and $5000. The Edition Collection will be fashioned from 18K gold and have sapphire crystal. This variant of the Apple Watch will also come with several expensive strap options. Apple, however, has not disclosed whether the chassis of this variant of the Apple Watch is solid gold or simply gold plated.


According to iGen.fr's sources, the Apple Watch will release by Feb. 2015 on Valentine's Day. Both resellers and distributors are fervently preparing for the mid-Feb release of the Apple Watch next year per the site.

Apple SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts' leaked video to employees let slip that the company would release the Apple Watch in Spring next year.

With the pricing of the stainless steel and gold variants of the Apple Watch veering towards the expensive, it seems the aluminum version is poised to be the low-end model. It will be interesting to see if consumers are willing to spend a bomb on a smartwatch whose performance is not known.
{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 639, 'Headline': 'Now the Vogue Rats Are Chewing Through Couture'} | discuss | unrelated | The World Health Organization is looking into reports that ISIS fighters in Iraq have been showing up at hospitals with Ebola symptoms.

According to the pro-government Iraqi newspaper al Sabaah, an unknown number of ISIS militants have shown up at a hospital in the militant-controlled city of Mosul, about 250 miles north of Baghdad. The paper reported that foreign terrorists brought the disease into Mosul from “several countries” in Africa. (RELATED: ISIS Massacred Every Man And Boy Over 15 In Muslim Town)

It’s not yet clear whether the ISIS extremists actually have Ebola or another disease. Ebola symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and unexplained bleeding and bruising — problems which could also be attributed to malaria or yellow fever. And doctors in Mosul might be unable to even test for Ebola.

WHO spokeswoman Christy Feig said the organization is reaching out to officials in the ISIS-held area to offer help if the disease does turn out to be Ebola. However, United Nations workers are not allowed to work in ISIS-controlled areas in either Iraq or Syria, so a UN operation to help either ISIS militants or any civilians in the areas who contract Ebola is unlikely.

Feig told Mashable that there’s been no official notification from the Iraqi government that the terrorists’ disease is, in fact, Ebola.

ISIS is against western science and medicine as a rule, but apparently several militants have taken to hospitals with Ebola-like symptoms anyway. Since taking control of Mosul in June 2014, ISIS has taken to executing doctors that refuse to treat them.

Kurdish news website Rudaw reported in Nov. 2014 that ISIS executed six doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded fighters, in addition to kidnapping six merchants for failing to pay a monthly tax to ISIS. The group reportedly executed two more doctors just last week.

The U.S. has been hitting ISIS with air strikes since mid-November and the Pentagon confirmed in December that the strikes have killed around 1,000 fighters, including three senior ISIS officials.

An Ebola outbreak, however unlikely, probably wouldn’t help matters much.

As of now, it's not a confirmed Ebola case.

“The patient claims to have had contact with the Dallas ‘patient zero.’ Frisco firefighter-paramedics are in the process of transporting the patient,” a statement from Dana Baird-Hanks, a spokeswoman with the city of Frisco, said.

Paramedics are reportedly transporting the patient, who has not yet been identified, to Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, the Morning News reported. Staff and patrons of the facility are being examined for the deadly virus.

Since Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola, there have been 5,000 false alarms in the U.S., Forbes wrote Wednesday. The Centers for Disease Controls said it received more than 800 calls a day regarding the deadly disease -- a drastic jump from the 50 calls a day it received before Duncan’s infection was known.

Duncan, the first person in the U.S. to become sick with virus, died Wednesday. “It is with profound sadness and heartfelt disappointment that we must inform you of the death of Thomas Eric Duncan,” said a statement from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where he was being treated. “He fought courageously in this battle.”

More than 3,400 people in West Africa have been killed by the latest outbreak. The virus might have been spread through handling “bushmeat,” which is the meat of African wild animals, and contact with infected bats.

{'Stance': 'agree', 'Body ID': 2260, 'Headline': 'Satirical news site attacks China’s weird English names'} | discuss | agree | A humorous report on a satirical Web site done in the style of China's state broadcaster CCTV offers advice to Chinese on how to choose their English names. "English names come with different connotations. It’s not always fair to those people, but they do," the article warns. "A name can come with a ‘feeling’ or idea about what sort of person you are, and where you come from."

The adoption of unconventional English names in China and other parts of East Asia is the source of perennial fascination and mirth among expats. Any young Anglophone who teaches English in the region could rattle off a host of perplexing names he or she had to call out during class.

One friend of WorldViews who taught English and civics in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou had a number of students whose chosen English names were derived from screen names used during online computer games. There was Orcapm, who was not to be outdone by Skycoolz.

"Sure, have fun and pick a random object or word as a name, but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America," the post chides. It offers this guide:

A good way to work out the ‘feeling’ of a name is to watch a bunch of American movies and sitcoms. They’re full of name stereotypes — you’ll find the good girls’ are all ‘Jane’s, the jock boys’ are still ‘Buds’ and the geeks’ are called ‘Sheldon’.

The report also lays out a set of rules governing the types of English names typically adopted by Chinese. Be careful about what may sound inappropriate alongside common Chinese family names such as Wang or Dong. In general, it's good to avoid food as a name, it suggests.

To put bluntly, names like Candy, Lolly, Sugar (think anything sweet), are typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.

It’s not always right; there are doubtless some very smart Candy’s out there. But it’s the first thing that comes to mind.

Other instructions include eschewing the names of famous leaders or celebrities. "Pick any name like Obama, Einstein or Madonna and you’re going to get some stares," it says. "You have some pretty big shoes to fill there."

At a McDonald's restaurant in Hong Kong, WorldViews once was served by an employee whose badge confusingly read "Franco Mussolini." One hopes he didn't harbor similar dreams of power and domination.

While it's easy to make fun of such unusual naming conventions, it's also hard not to appreciate the playfulness with which these names get chosen. Often, Chinese people pick an English name as a play of words based on their original given Chinese name. The Atlantic offers a few examples from the Cantonese-speaking city of Hong Kong:

Many English names mimic the sound of Chinese given names. A solicitor called Tse Kar-son, for example, has Carson as his English name. Singer Lee Hak-kan's English name is Hacken. Another singer, Chan Yik-shun, is called Eason...

Ho Wai-leuk, a journalist, got his name another way. "When I was a student, everyone kept saying my Chinese name really fast until it started sounding like 'hoh lok,'" he said referring to the Cantonese pronunciation for Coca-Cola, "so Cola stuck."

For most people, our names are our names and we have little choice in the matter. But the practice of adopting a new English name can be seen as an exercise in self-expression, especially in societies where larger trends of conformity hold some sway.

Who wouldn't want to be able to re-brand themselves or be able to highlight some unique part of their identity? Just don't use that power to call yourself "Bunny Wang," the post says.

Correction: An earlier version of this story reported that the original post was from CCTV. It was, in fact, by a satirical news site.

"These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false," agent Mark Steinberg said. "They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous."

On Monday morning, the PGA Tour responded to the claims.

"There is no truth whatsoever to these claims. We categorically deny these allegations," said Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour.

Woods is on leave from the PGA Tour as he tries to sort out issues with his game, especially with his chipping. Woods, who said he would not return to the Tour until he can compete with the best in the game, missed the cut in the Waste Management Phoenix Open in his first tournament of the season – shooting a career-high 82 in the process – and then withdrew with a stiff back after 11 holes the following week in the Farmers Insurance Open.

Woods said his back problems are not the reason for his hiatus from the game, nor are they related to the injuries that forced him to have back surgery last March 31.

"I've heard that he's suspended. I heard he's on a month's suspension. And it's not, it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person that's telling me this," Olsen said Friday on the radio show. "Well, it's not testosterone, but it's something else."

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 944, 'Headline': 'Sugarhill Gang rapper Big Bank Hank dead at 57'} | discuss | unrelated | (CNN) -- A company whose video chat service apparently captured audio of Michael Brown's shooting said Thursday the recording was created at the time the Missouri teenager was killed this month.

The revelation from Glide appears to bolster a man's claim that he inadvertently recorded audio of gunfire at the time a police officer shot and killed the 18-year-old Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on August 9.

The video was created at 12:02:14 p.m. that day, Glide said. Brown, who was unarmed, was shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shortly after noon.

"A Glide user living nearby was simply using the Glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed -- to instantly communicate with a friend through our real-time video texting service. Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown," the company said.

The sounds could be a piece in the larger puzzle of what happened during the shooting, which spurred days of protests in the city of 21,000.

Police have said Brown was trying to grab the officer's gun. Witnesses say the teen was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot. Investigators are determining whether to accuse the officer of wrongdoing; no charges have been filed.

The FBI obtained the audio and interviewed the man who made the recording, said Lopa Blumenthal, a lawyer for that individual.

The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the Brown shooting and happened to be using the application at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

The significance of the pause

Witnesses and a friend of Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led to Brown's death, and the pause could be key in the investigation. But it's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Ferguson police have alleged that Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting, and that he and a friend, Dorian Johnson, were walking down a street when Wilson approached them in a police car.

Police say Wilson stopped Brown not because of the theft, but because Brown and a friend were blocking traffic. Wilson tried to exit his vehicle but Brown pushed him back into the car, according to a preliminary investigation, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said.

Read the police reports

Brown assaulted the officer while Wilson was in the car, and a shot was fired inside the police car during a struggle over the officer's gun, Belmar said.

Johnson disputes that, saying Wilson -- while sitting in the car -- started the scuffle by grabbing Brown by the neck, and that Brown tried to pull away. Johnson also said that there was no struggle for the gun, but rather that Wilson drew the weapon and shot Brown once at the car.

Johnson said Wilson shot Brown again as the teen ran away. According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a woman who identified herself as a friend of Wilson called in to a St. Louis radio show with what she said was the officer's version of events.

The caller, who identified herself only as "Josie," said Brown -- after going away from the vehicle following the first shot -- turned around, taunted the officer and charged at him. Her account matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN.

An autopsy showed Brown had six gunshot wounds.

Attorney Chris Chestnut told CNN this week he was surprised by the gap in shots.

"It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon," said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer. That incident occurred in North Carolina.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

"To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause," said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's "Crossfire." "Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' "

Several journalists reporting from the ground on Tuesday night -- and at least one Kurdish official -- said they were aware of such reports, but that doctors lack necessary equipment to diagnose the cause of Kurdish victims' complaints. The patients said they had difficulty breathing, and many had burns on their skin, teary eyes and swollen lips. Syria (as well as Iraq) is thought to possess chemical weapons, and the U.S. and coalition forces have feared that such weapons might fall into ISIS hands.

"It could have been a silent missile or a missile placed in the neighborhood beforehand,” co-chair of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) Asya Abdullah told the Kurdish Question. “Many people have lost consciousness and are struggling to breathe and see. We are investigating the situation but do not have the necessary technical equipment or expertise."

Journalists reporting from the border of Kobani and Turkey reportedly spoke to doctors on the scene who confirmed the PYD’s description of victims. Al Aan TV reporter Jenan Moussa posted on Twitter that a doctor said “victims who are on their way to clinic speak of following symptoms: teary eyes, suffocation and skin burns.” Victims also had “swollen lips,” Moussa added.

Kurdish affairs analyst Mutlu Civiroglu spoke to one of four remaining doctors inside Kobani, who told him all victims were civilians.

“Several patients came to health center at 11:10pm with burn in the throat & as well as complaining about headache, though their situation is NOT very severe," Dr. Ahmed reportedly told Civiroglu. "We are NOT sure what the cause is yet, but we are planning to send affected patients to Suruc [neighboring city in the Turkish side of the border] in the morning for further examination.”

Reports of a similar chemical attack surfaced last week in Kobani, when several Kurdish fighters’ bodies appeared to show signs of blistering.

“Burns and white spots on the bodies of the dead indicated the use of chemicals, which led to death without any visible wounds or external bleeding,” Kurdish health minister Nisan Ahmed told Middle East Review of International Affairs journal.

There have been rumors that ISIS militants have obtained chemical weapons. Given that Kobani is on the Syrian border with Turkey, the weapons could have come from an undisclosed Syrian stockpile that used to belong to the Damascus regime.

After the Bashar Assad regime carried out a chemical attack that killed nearly a thousand people last year, it was forced to dismantle and surrender stockpiles. A year after the attack though, the U.S. State Department said that a “number of critical issues remain unresolved” about the Syrian president's chemical weapons.

The substance allegedly being used in Kobani has yet to be confirmed. However, there have been several chlorine attacks in Syria since Assad was supposed to have surrendered his weapons cache. Chlorine is not banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention but when used in large concentrations it can be weaponized. Symptoms of chlorine attacks include teary eyes, a burning sensation in the throat, the sensation of suffocation and a headache.

ISIS has been battling Kurdish fighters in Kobani for over a month, trying to consolidate territory from their de-facto headquarters in Raqqa to the Turkish border. Despite an increase in U.S-led coalition airstrikes and aid drops aimed at pushing insurgents back and helping Kurdish fighters, the battle for Kobani continued Tuesday night.
{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 900, 'Headline': 'CNN Posts Alleged Audio of Michael Brown Shooting'} | discuss | unrelated | A hoax story alleging the British graffiti artist Banksy has been arrested and has had his identity revealed has once again duped thousands of people online.

According to the highly refutable website National Report, a 'news' website consisting entirely of fake stories, the artist was arrested by Metropolitan Police at his studio and his identity revealed as 35-year-old Paul Horner, originally from Liverpool.

The article contains all the elements you would expect to see from a news story covering an arrest, including details from police and quotes from those close to Banksy.

However, it only takes the bare minimum of fact-checking and research to spot that this story is a hoax.

The article claims the story has been confirmed by the BBC (it hasn't) and that City of London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy's arrest (he never did and Edwards doesn't even exist).

US news site CNN also did not conduct an interview with Banksy's "project manager" John Hawes following his arrest (also because he doesn't exist).

The 'revealed identity' of Banksy is also suspicious.

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager's house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.

The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics, a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who, unsurprisingly since his previous stories include 'Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month' and 'Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis', has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.

One final, major clue that the story is a hoax is that the exact same thing has happened before. Last February, a fake press release that again claimed Banksy has been arrested and again claimed his name is Paul Horner did the rounds, with Jezebel being one of the more high-profile websites to publish the hoax before later taking it down.

Despite this, the latest 'Banksy arrested' story has been shared more than 200,000 times on Facebook and Twitter, proving there are still people who will believe anything they read on the internet.

{'Stance': 'disagree', 'Body ID': 1975, 'Headline': 'Michelle Obama’s face blurred by Saudi state television'} | discuss | disagree | Video clips circulated online Tuesday that purported to show that Saudi state television blurred out First Lady Michelle Obama at a meeting between President Barack Obama and the new Saudi king.

However, observers of the live broadcast — including a Wall Street Journal reporter in the country — said that there was no blurring of Mrs. Obama, and that the broadcast showed her shaking hands with King Salman.

The Saudi embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement provided to Bloomberg View, the embassy’s information director said: “Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred.” Various clips posted of the ceremony elsewhere show no blurring of Mrs. Obama or of her handshake with the new king.

The Obamas made a stop in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday on their way back from India to pay respects to the late King Abdullah and to meet with the new leader of a longtime American ally. The visit came amid continued criticism of Saudi Arabia’s policies regarding women’s rights, which served to put the interactions between the first lady and Saudi officials under a spotlight.

Mrs. Obama dressed conservatively, with long pants and long sleeves. The first lady didn’t wear a headscarf in the conservative Muslim country — a standard part of Saudi Arabia’s state-mandated dress code. But covering the head isn’t required for foreigners, though only 3% of Saudis believe that a women without a headscarf is appropriately dressed in public, according to a 2014 study by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research.

Her appearance drew notice on Twitter. Social media users tweeted using an Arabic hashtag that translates to #MichelleObama_NotVeiled.


 


 

Others wondered why she had covered her head on a previous trip, to Indonesia. The photos used were from a 2010 visit to the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 60, 'Headline': 'Eggnog-chugging contest leads to hospital stay'} | discuss | unrelated | The White House is attempting to verify footage released by the Islamic State (IS) purporting to show the killing of an American journalist in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

The video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man cloaked in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012. The White House said it was working to establish the video's authenticity, but if it was genuine, the US would be “appalled by the brutal murder”.

Foley has worked in a number of conflict zones in the Middle East, including Syria, Libya and Iraq. He and another journalist were working in the northern province of Idlib in Syria when they were kidnapped in November 2012 near the village of Taftanaz.

The video opened with a clip of US President Barack Obama saying he had authorised strikes in Iraq. “Obama authorises military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims,” words appear in English and Arabic on the screen. It showed black and white aerial footage of air strikes with text saying “American aggression against the Islamic State”

A person identified as James Foley and wearing an orange outfit is seen kneeling in the desert as a man in black dress with a black mask stands beside him, holding a knife. “I call on my friends family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” the kneeling man says.

The man in the mask says: “This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen, of your country. As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State. Today your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide.”

Following his statement he beheads the kneeling man.

The video also shows a second man on his knees, who is named as Steven Sotloff, another American journalist, who was kidnapped in Syria in August 2013. After bringing out Sotloff, the masked executioner addresses the US President directly, saying: “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”

The Islamic State had not previously executed American citizens publicly. The video was posted after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq for the first time since the end of the US occupation in 2011. A Twitter account set up by Mr Foley’s family to help find him said early on Wednesday: “We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 381, 'Headline': 'Boko Haram: Kidnapped Girls Have Been Married Off, Truce Never Happened'} | discuss | unrelated | “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2015 that is scheduled to be released during winter. The latest reports, however, claim that J.J. Abrams, the director of the seventh episode of the epic space opera, wants an early release date for his movie.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is currently scheduled to be released on Dec. 18, 2015. Based on YouTuber Votesaxon 07’s video, Movie Pilot reports that J.J. Abrams wants to release “Episode 7” in the summer of 2015. The report by the aforementioned entertainment news publication claims that the 48-year-old director made the announcement at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015.

The publication claims that the reason why J.J. Abrams wants to release “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” almost six months before its scheduled date is the alleged plot and images leaks from the sets and script. The moviemaker is now worried that these plot leaks will make the film “predictable and not worth watching” for the audience.

According to the website, moving the release date forward would be “an extremely brave move,” putting it up against other fan-favourite releases such as “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Jurassic World” and “Ant-Man.” However, shifting the release date means a lot of work for the moviemakers and the studio. Meanwhile, Ikwiz reports that Disney is “seriously” considering J.J. Abrams' demand of summer release of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

Fans must note that these reports lack official comments from the associated parties; thus, the information must be taken with a pinch of salt. However, fans know that Disney is seriously dealing with the issue of image leak. Recently, the studio issued a subpoena over the leak of images from “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

In additional news, J.J. Abrams finally broke his silence on the controversy over the new lightsaber that debuted in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” trailer. Speaking to Collider at a Hollywood event, the director admitted receiving tons of emails arguing about the new lightsaber and its functionality.

"It's been the funniest thing to see the arguments that have developed over this thing,” J.J Abrams said. "This was not done without a lot of conversation. It's fun to see people have the conversation that we had, but in reverse,” the director explained.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” features John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, Harrison For as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, and Domhnall Gleeson, Max von Sydow and Adam Driver, all in unspecified roles. Stay tuned for more updates.

A teacher is facing the sack after she was secretly filmed having sex with one of her pupils - and the video ended up on a porn site.

Argentinian beauty Lucita Sandoval was unwittingly recorded having sex with a 16-year-old pupil who switched camera phone on after asking the teacher to turn around.

The teenager, who wear a football shirt throughout the 23 minute long video, is then seen giving the thumbs up and smiling before panning round to show his naked teacher engaging in sexual acts with him.

According to newspapers in Argentina, 26-year-old Miss Sandoval realises later on that she is being filmed, but appears to do nothing about it.

It has been reported that the pupil told the teacher he had deleted the footage, but instead he shared it with his friends on WhatsApp .

The graphic footage was then shared hundreds of times around the country and even ended up on a pornographic website.

Miss Sandoval has allegedly faced previous disciplinary hearings at the school in Santiago del Estro over inappropriate relationships with pupils, but nothing was done due to lack of evidence.

With the emergence of the video, education authorities have now said they will be forced to act against the teacher.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 2022, 'Headline': 'MACAULAY CULKIN IS THE LATEST VICTIM OF A CELEBRITY DEATH HOAX — AND THESE 9 STARS KNOW EXACTLY HOW HE FEELS!'} | discuss | unrelated | A newspaper report that Kim Jong-un has been hospitalized for ankle surgery has fuelled new theories about the North Korean leader’s long absence from the public eye.

Kim has not been seen in public in almost a month and missed a session of parliament on Sept. 25 for the first time since coming to power almost three years ago. Since an event with key officials in July, he has been seen walking with a limp. In an unusual acknowledgment last Friday, North Korean state television said he was experiencing “discomfort.”

Details from the Hermit Kingdom on Kim’s state of health are scarce and hard to verify, but the new details reported by the Chosun Ilbo newspaper paint a broader picture of what may have happened to him. Here is what is suspected so far.

Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, photos released by state media show. He is shown below in photos released by the Korean Central News Agency on Oct. 9, 2010, at left, and July 28, 2014, at right:

Kim is believed to be between 5-foot-2 and 5-foot-9, possibly weighing 280 pounds. Chosun Ilbo cited a recent visitor to North Korea (whom it did not identify) as saying that Kim’s weight gain, combined with an intense tour schedule of factories and military bases, as factors in his ankle injury.

Kim cracked bones in his ankles after neglecting an injury sustained during field supervisions in June, the source cited by Chosun Ilbo said. The source said Kim had surgery and is recovering at Bongwha Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members, according to the newspaper.

Surgery to the ankles could be consistent with gout, Alastair Hepburn, a consultant rheumatologist and a Medical Trustee of the U.K. Gout Society. “It’s unusual but it’s possible,” Hepburn said in a telephone interview. Severe gout can damage the joints, making an operation necessary, he said.

North Korea observers speculate Kim’s weight and family background may have contributed to his condition. “Based on his gait, it appears he has gout – something [due to] diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family,” said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North website.

Gout is a form of arthritis that isn’t fatal, though it can be agonizingly painful. The condition is caused by a buildup of a waste product in the blood called uric acid, which normally is eliminated from the body through urine, according to the U.K.’s National Health Service. Uric acid can cause needle-like crystals to form, which seep into joints and cause inflammation.

“Gout is a very painful and debilitating condition,” said Hepburn of the U.K. Gout Society. “It can lead to a situation when limping becomes obvious because of the pain. A person can be quite well for some time, and then there may be sudden flareups, which cause more pain.”

Chosun Ilbo’s report also said that Kim was believed to be wearing shoes with Cuban heels, a style of two-inch high-heeled men’s footwear, to make him taller and give him a more authoritative appearance. Kim is shown below wearing such shoes in a 2012 appearance with his wife, Ri Sol-ju:

Among the interesting details is the existence of an unannounced "Power Reserve" mode for the watch that will display only the time and cut off all other functions as the battery begins to run critically low, preserving the most basic functionality of the watch. The report also notes that while the Apple Watch has been widely tested by Apple employees, the company did work to conceal many of those prototypes by disguising them to resemble Samsung smartwatches.

Sources have also provided more context to a Wall Street Journal article from last month that discussed how many of the originally planned health features for Apple Watch were dropped due to consistency issues. According to The New York Times' sources, the decision to drop many of those features came more than 18 months ago, refuting off-target reports in recent weeks claiming the cuts have come at the last minute.Nearly two years ago, the company experimented with advanced health monitoring sensors that tracked blood pressure and stress, among other variables. Many of those experiments were abandoned more than 18 months ago after the sensors proved unreliable and cumbersome, these people said.

Apple long ago decided that for the first version of the product, it would include a heart rate sensor and a sensor for tracking movement, to market the device as a fitness-tracking companion to the iPhone. Previous reports have indicated Apple is still working on those technologies, and they could appear in future versions of the Apple Watch.

Today's report reveals some additional insight into the development process, noting that the Apple Watch is coming a bit later than originally hoped due to technical challenges that were likely exacerbated by the loss of several engineers working on the project. Google's Nest Labs, headed by iPod pioneer Tony Fadell, was responsible for poaching several of the key Apple Watch employees.

Apple's media event will take place at 10:00 AM Pacific Time on Monday, March 9 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. The company will offer a live video stream of the event, and MacRumors will provide full coverage of the event.

The bloody penis was delivered to the local hospital but a surgeon skilled enough to carry out the reattachment couldn't be found.

Ilic was then transferred to the hospital in the capital Skopje, where surgeons managed to reattach the penis in a complicated five-hour surgery.

They said it was still too early to know if the operation would be a success and whether the man's organ would ever function properly again.

This was the second recent example of a Macedonian man cutting off a penis.

Another 40-year-old man did the same a short while ago but in his case the member was not reattached because he had thrown it into the toilet and flushed it away.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 737, 'Headline': 'Setting the record straight on tor'} | discuss | unrelated | Amazon.com announced plans for its first brick-and-mortar store, Dow Jones reported. It will open on 34th Street in Manhattan across the street from the Empire State Building, just in time for this year's holiday season.

The experimental pop-up store will function as a small warehouse, holding limited inventory for same-day deliveries only in New York. The store may also host tech showcases for items such as Kindle e-readers, Fire phones and Fire TVs.

A customer may order an item online and then pick it up that same day in the store.

Amazon stock was down 2 percent in midafternoon trading Thursday.

The company risks increasing costs related to retailing such as paying leases and hiring workers. But if the store is successful, it may set a precedent for additional stores in other cities.

Amazon has been researching and scouting a possible store for several years, said a person familiar with the project. Two years ago, the company went as far as scouting spots in Seattle, where it is headquartered.

"Same-day delivery, ordering online and picking up in-store are ideas that are really catching on. Amazon needs to be at the center of that," Matt Nemer, a Wells Fargo analyst, told Dow Jones.

Other companies such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot have already incorporated this order-online, pick-up in-store model. Clothing company Bonobos opened 10 stores in 2011 and plans to expand to 40 stores by 2016.

Amazon tried brick-and-mortar experiments before, such as Kindle vending machines that sold tablets and e-readers in malls.
{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 2272, 'Headline': 'Devoted pet owner spends £300 to save his GOLDFISH after it became constipated'} | discuss | unrelated | MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — The leader of Boko Haram has denied agreeing to any cease-fire with the Nigerian government, and said he married off the more than 200 schoolgirls that the Islamic extremist group kidnapped.

In a new video released late Friday night, Abubakar Shekau dashed hopes for a prisoner exchange to get the girls released.

"The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off," he said, laughing. "In this war, there is no going back."

Nigeria's chief of defense staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, on Oct. 17 announced that Boko Haram had agreed to an immediate cease-fire to end a 5-year-old insurgency that has killed thousands of people, and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in northeast Nigeria.

But attacks and abductions have continued, with the extremists this week seizing Mubi, a town of more than 200,000 people. Fighting also continued Friday in Vimtin, the nearby village where Badeh was born.

Shekau in August announced that Boko Haram wanted to establish an Islamic caliphate, along the lines of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. Fleeing residents have reported that hundreds of people are being detained for infractions of the extremists' version of strict Shariah law in several towns and villages under their control.

Boko Haram's kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls taking exams at a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April prompted an international campaign for their release and criticism of Nigeria's government for not acting quickly to free them. Dozens of the girls escaped on their own in the first few days, but 219 remain missing. The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls has been used on social media sites, including Facebook and Twitter, in an effort to spark conversation about the kidnappings. Nobel Peace Prize laureate and international education activist Malala Yousafzai visited Nigeria in July, and urged Boko Haram to free the kidnapped girls, calling them her "sisters."

Unconfirmed reports have indicated that the girls have been broken up into several groups, and that some may have been carried across borders into Cameroon and Chad.

The government had said it had negotiated with two Boko Haram leaders in Chad, with talks hosted by President Idriss Deby, and that it was confident the girls would be freed soon. But Boko Haram has many factions.

Shekau's announcement further discredits the government of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who on Thursday formally announced his candidacy for elections on Feb. 14, 2015, in Africa's most populous nation. Nigeria, with some 160 million people, is divided almost equally between Muslims who dominate the north and Christians in the south. The West African nation is the biggest oil producer on the continent and has its biggest economy.

Jonathan's failure to curtail the insurgency and many corruption scandals are not expected to dim his chances of success. The election, though, is expected to be the most hotly contested since his People's Democratic Party took power after decades of military dictatorship ended in 1994.

Dozens of ruling party legislators have defected to the coalition All Progressives Congress, losing the PDP its majority in the lower house of Parliament. But the coalition is weakened by its inability to choose a presidential candidate, and primaries in December will be contested by three powerful northerners who all are Muslim.

Jonathan, a Christian from a minority southern tribe, has been criticized for ignoring an unwritten party rule to alternate power between Christian and Muslim leaders, adding a religious and ethnic dimension to the election.

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Vice founder Shane Smith recently balled out exceptionally hard on a dinner for a group of 12 at the Prime Steakhouse in Las Vegas, racking up a $300,000 check.

A source at Vice told BuzzFeed News that Smith won a sum “well north of that bill” while gambling during his week at the CES conference in Las Vegas, and paid for the dinner on his personal credit card. (A Financial Times report says Smith won $1 million; both the FT and New York Times say there were about 30 people eating on Smith’s dime.)

Smith himself hasn’t commented on the story, which is a pity, because the world needs to know the answer to a crucial question: How can you spend $300,000 on dinner?

So in that spirit, we checked out the menu at Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino.

Prime’s Siberian Sturgeon Caviar with traditional accompaniments was likely a must for Smith’s group. The restaurant lists the item as market price, but Eater Las Vegas has it going for up to $2,500 per pound. A couple pounds of caviar seems reasonable.

ALLEKO/ALLEKO

Mercifully for Smith, Prime doesn’t put its wine list online. But just down the strip at Mario Batali’s Carnevino in the Wynn, a few bottles of Dom Perignon (2003) will run guests $400 each.

But what are we, farmers? Any respectable internet baron is going to spring for a couple of bottles of the best champagne in the house. At Batali’s joint, a 1.5-liter bottle of Boërl & Kroff 1998 will set you back $15,000 each.

AntonMatveev/AntonMatveev

Obviously white wine accompanies any good foodie’s fish course. Smith’s crew could have grabbed a couple bottles of the $9,000 Montrachet, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti from 2007. An average year, but sometimes compromise is necessary.

Manakin/Manakin

For the reds, perhaps a couple of vintages on the more reasonable side, like the $5,000 per bottle Sine Qua Non “Just for the Love of It” 2002 Syrah.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 1336, 'Headline': "ISIS pays tribute to its 'Cub of Baghdadi' child soldier"} | discuss | unrelated | Two U.S. officials say they believe American journalist James Foley was the victim executed by ISIS militants as shown in a grisly video released Tuesday.

Separately, Foley’s family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a webpage that was created to rally support for his release.

In the statement, Foley’s mother, Diane Foley, said the journalist, quote, “gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.”

One of the U.S. officials said President Barack Obama was expected to make a statement about the killing on Wednesday.

The U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the video by name.

Foley, a 40-year-old freelance journalist from Rochester, New Hampshire, went missing nearly two years ago in northern Syria while on assignment for Agence France-Press and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost. The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control. He had not been heard from since.

Several senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the last two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar, the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil.

Both areas are in northern Iraq, which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the hostage situation by name.

Since Aug. 8, the U.S. military has struck more than 70 Islamic State targets – including security checkpoints, vehicles and weapons caches. It’s not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes, although it’s likely that some were.

The Internet video begins with scenes of President Barack Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes in Iraq. Then it switches to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert, a black-clad Islamic State fighter by his side. Foley’s name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen. The video appears to have been shot in an arid area; there is no vegetation in sight and the horizon is in the distance where the sand meets the gray-blue sky.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists estimated Tuesday that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria, and has not released their nationalities. In its annual report last November, CPJ concluded that the missing journalists are either being held and threatened with death by extremists, or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom. The group’s report described the widespread seizure of journalists as unprecedented and largely unreported by news organizations in the hope that keeping the kidnappings out of public view may help in the captives’ release.

The Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al-Qaida’s leaders. In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control, the extremists have killed soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying executions – including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes.

The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al-Qaida in Iraq, which beheaded many of its victims, including Americans businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004.

A female passenger dressed in a hazmat suit — complete with a full body gown, mask and gloves — was spotted Wednesday waiting for a flight at the airport. Another traveler snapped a photo of the woman and provided it to The Daily Caller.

Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed of Ebola on American soil, had a layover at Dulles last month while traveling from West Africa to Texas. He died last week.

Health officials have said that passengers at the airport were not at risk for exposure to Ebola because Duncan was not symptomatic at the time of his flight.

{'Stance': 'agree', 'Body ID': 839, 'Headline': 'ADVISORY-Islamist rebel leader killed in U.S. strike - Somali government'} | discuss | agree | WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Friday confirmed that the leader of al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda-linked organization in Africa, was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Somalia this week.

The leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, was targeted Monday in an airstrike that hit a vehicle and compound in a militant stronghold south of the capital, Mogadishu.

Al-Shabab has been linked to a number of attacks in Africa, including the bloody siege at the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 2013 that killed 67 people.

"Removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to al-Shabab," Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement.

At the time of the strike, the Pentagon said it could not confirm Godane's death.

Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions were used to strike the targets. Both manned aircraft and unmanned drones participated in the attack.

The Pentagon said no U.S. ground troops were involved in the operation.

"The United States works in coordination with its friends, allies and partners to counter the regional and global threats posed by violent extremist organizations," Kirby said in the statement released Friday.

The United States has backed the Somali government, which has pushed the terrorist groups out of Mogadishu. Despite the government successes, the terror group has been able to operate in parts of the country that remain out of the reach of the government's influence.

The White House said it would continue to pursue the organization.

"Even as this is an important step forward in the fight against al-Shabab, the United States will continue to use the tools at our disposal –- financial, diplomatic, intelligence and military –- to address the threat that al-Shabaab and other terrorist groups pose to the United States and the American people," the White House said in a statement.

A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.
Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.

“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.

The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, made a public statement this morning stating that Father O’neal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isn’t a female.

The analyst predicts that the stainless steel Apple Watch will be priced at $499, while the 18k Gold Edition will sell for $4,999, AppleInsider reports. He also said that on average, consumers will spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Apple watch versions

Apple Watch will be released in three separate price tiers i.e. Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, with each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices. Starting with Apple Watch Sport, Munster expects an ASP (average selling price) of $450 including configuration choices like case and internal storage options. The stainless steel Apple Watch model is expected to start at $499 to $549, with an overall ASP at around $650. Regarding the Apple Watch Edition, the analyst forecasts the base model to start at $4,999, while classifying segment ASP at $7,500.

Based on current pricing for Apple’s silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars. 

“If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,” Munster writes. 

Lastly, Munster expects the Sport model to make up 55% of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take 45%. As for Apple Watch Edition, Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year.

Based on what we know so far about the Apple Watch, which model do you plan on getting?

As the anchor said, social media, as well as a few news websites, owes meteorologist Mike Seidel an “apology” after some “wild misinformation” circulated about what he was doing during a live appearance with Lester Holt over the weekend.

Williams explained that Seidel has lost communication with the NBC station and couldn’t hear Holt through his earpiece so he turned his back to the camera, took off his gloves and redialed his phone to connect for the segment.

“That’s when the rumors hit the web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow,” Williams said. “It was just Mike working to make it right, which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel.”

But, of course, that explanation is far less hilarious and would likely generate almost zero clicks.

The new 1 World Trade Center offices of Vogue magazine are infested with rodents and editor-in-chief Anna Wintour is not happy, according to a report.
The 25th- and 26th-floor digs of the Condé Nast publication are overrun with vermin, and Wintour has ­issued an edict to staffers to clear her glass-walled office of the long-tailed pests before she steps a stiletto heel on the premises.
Luckily, Wintour is not expected to take up full-time residence at America’s tallest building until after the New Year.
A Vogue employee wrote to Gawker Friday afternoon to say that there are so many creatures scuttling around 1 WTC that the editorial department may be postponing its move from the old Times Square offices.
“A serious concern (laughable but I guess it makes sense) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through,” the staffer said.
Vogue tracked its downtown relocation in a special online story declaring, “Batten the hatches, lower Manhattan, because we’re coming for you.”
The mag’s Instagram account has photos of models and singer Will.i.am hauling boxes.


The article describes the moving scene as a “living Lego set of natty Hermès-colored Rent-a-crates” at 4 Times Square.
Busybodies in a chatroom on the Web site SkyscraperCity.com delighted in the vermin problem that has brought a highbrow publication to a new low.
“Security couldn’t even stop BASE jumpers from ­entering the building and leaping from the top. You think they could stop some rats?” a commenter named “4npower” wrote.
Another commenter, “Lady­Amanita,” speculated that the scourge is overblown.
“Rats probably wouldn’t want to live on the 25th and 26th floors of a high-rise,” she wrote, adding, “It’s possible that they have mice and freaked-out Condé Nasties are confusing their rodents.”

@ScottishSPCA is Kai still available for adoption? located in Canada but love the breed and will pay any necessary costs to have him come.

“Normally, when we get an abandonment, it’s usually a staffie and we don’t tend to get many offers to re-home them, but when it’s an unusual breed or a particularly cute one, then we get a lot of interest.

“I’m sure Kai’s story has tugged at a lot of heartstrings.”

The Scottish SPCA has asked for anyone with any information about the ‘cruel incident’ to contact them.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 2132, 'Headline': 'North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un to open restaurant in Scotland'} | discuss | unrelated | The video was one of those viral sensations that tugs on your heartstrings and compels you to watch, because it defies your expectations and shows you just how kind and compassionate human beings can be. There was only one problem.

The video was a fake — at least according to a witness who says he was there while the YouTube hit, “How Does A Homeless Man Spend $100?” was filmed.

You have probably seen the video by now — if not, view it above. Posted by the prolific prankster Josh Paler Lin — whose other videos include “Sex In The Bathroom Prank” and “Rock Paper Scissors Hickey!” — the viral video purported to be a “social experiment” in which Paler Lin gave a homeless man identified as “Thomas” a hundred bucks in cash, then “secretly” filmed him as he spent the money.

The video was picked up by dozens of media outlets, including the Inquisitr, and in the week the clip has been on YouTube, has racked up more than 28 million views.

Why? Because Thomas spent his money not on booze or drugs, but on food. And not just for himself. He used the cash to purchase and distribute food to his fellow homeless people in Orange County, California.

While determining how much revenue any particular YouTube video creates is difficult, by many estimates a video can earn between $1,000 and $5,000 for each million views it accumulates.

That means Paler Lin may have grossed anywhere from $28,000 to $140,000 off this single video — in one week.

Perhaps more important, Paler Lin created a crowdfunding campaign along with the video, to raise more money for Thomas. That campaign has so far brought in about $130,000 in donations from people moved by the selfless acts Thomas performs in the video.

But in an interview posted on the site Vocativ on Tuesday, Taugan Tan Kadalim, who says he stumbled by chance across Paler Lin filming the video and witnessed the whole thing, calls the entire scenario “bull****.”

Kadalim, 26, says that he was there at Euclid Liquor & Market where he had just purchased a lottery ticket before walking across the street to his girlfriend’s apartment, and that what he saw made it clear that “Thomas knew he was being followed.”

Kadalim says he is a fan of Paler Lin and recognized the YouTube celebrity immediately.

He then watched as Paler Lin entered the liquor store and spoke with a clerk as Thomas waited outside. Only after Paler Lin returned, Kadalim told Vocativ, did Thomas enter the liquor store.

“He drove Thomas to the liquor store,” Kadalim told the site. “While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.”

Vocativ said its reporters corroborated the story with Kadalim’s girlfriend and brother, but calls to the liquor store went unreturned. Kadalim posted a comment to the video’s YouTube page the day the video went on line, saying quote clearly that Paler Lin drove Thomas to the store, but the comment went largely ignored.

Paler Lin, however, adamantly denied faking any part of the “homeless” viral video, telling Vocativ, “There is no way we’re making any of this up. This is real.”

“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement today. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”

"I know that at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas," Hunter claimed. "There's nobody talking about it."

"If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol," he continued.

One source close to Hunter worked to walk back the comment, emphasizing that the congressman received a tip from a “high level” source at U.S. Customs and Border Protection who told him that a group of people with “suspected ISIS affiliation” –- even Americans who traveled to Syria to fight with the Free Syrian Army against President Bashar al-Assad –- were apprehended at the border.

The tip "was from a confidential source with the Border Patrol," the source said in an email. "[It’s] more accurate to say people with known associations. Not 'fighters' in the sense folks might immediately think."

While DHS and several other congressional sources shot down the claim outright, a spokesman for Hunter said that the congressman fears ISIS sympathizers could easily melt into U.S. cities and breed home-grown terrorism.

“The Congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,” Joe Kasper, deputy chief of staff to Hunter, wrote in response to the DHS denial. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

Customs and Border Protection is part of DHS.

Hunter’s office declined an ABC News request to interview the congressman.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 1817, 'Headline': 'Vice Media’s CEO blew $300,000 on dinner, and a Vegas casino boss blabbed about it'} | discuss | unrelated | The FBI is reportedly investigating a new audiotape that allegedly captures the shooting of Michael Brown, according to CNN.

In the tape, you can hear what sounds like at least 10 shots fired, with a significant pause separating the shooting into two segments. CNN's Don Lemon said the news network hasn't confirmed the tape's authenticity. Michael Brown was shot at least six times according to an autopsy.

Lopa Blumenthal, a Missouri-based attorney for the unidentified man who unknowingly captured the shooting while video-chatting with a friend, claimed on CNN that the tape shows that Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson had a "point of contemplation" before firing the final volley of shots.

The man who recorded the audio "was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat," Blumenthal said. "He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building."

"I was very concerned about that pause," she said, "because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up."

It wasn't clear whether Blumenthal had any direct connection to the Brown case.

Retired Chief Deputy U.S. Marshall Matthew Fog, speaking on CNN after hearing the tape, said, "There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern."

The tape appears to have drawn the interest of Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Michael Brown's family. He retweeted a tweet Wednesday night from a CNN viewer that said, "Audio recording of shooting just released. Has been played on CNN by Don Lemon at least 5 xs. Very interesting. Proves alot [sic]."

Mashable has reached out to both Blumenthal and Crump for comment and we will update this post if and when we hear back.

{'Stance': 'agree', 'Body ID': 902, 'Headline': "No, Jordan's King Abdullah II is not personally flying planes against Isis"} | discuss | agree | A Jordanian government spokesman has denied rumours that the Jordanian King Abdullah II, a trained pilot, is personally conducting airstrikes against the Islamic State (Isis).

Mohammed al-Momani said in a statement that reports about the personal involvement of the King in combat missions on IS targets is unfounded and baseless.

Rumours on King Abdullah spread after the he promised to fight back hard against IS, saying that the death of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh "will not be in vain".

"We are waging this war to protect our faith, our values and human principles and our war for their sake will be relentless and will hit them in their own ground," he said on state television.

Momani had revealed earlier that Jordan will intensify its efforts with an US-led coalition against IS.

Later on Wednesday, Abdullah vowed "relentless" war against IS, saying Jordan will "hit them on their own ground".

Iraqi news outlets cited unofficial sources saying that the king was personally flying a plane. Jordanian author Waleed Abu Anada tweeted:

BREAKING: Local reports here in Jordan say that King Abdullah will personally fly and lead the airstrikes against ISIS tomorrow. #IAmMoath— Waleed Abu Nada (@waleedabunada) February 4, 2015

Before becoming king, Abdullah II was a general in charge of Jordanian special forces and a certified Cobra Helicopter pilot. In 1980 he joined the UK's Royal military academy Sandhurst.

After the barbaric video of Kasasbeh burning to death emerged, The Royal Hashemite Court's Facebook page published a picture of the King in pilot gear:

The picture was retweeted several times and used by some as a proof that the Jordanian king was gearing up to fight IS in person.

Others used an old picture of the King on the cockpit of a plane to wrongly suggest Abdullah had carried out his first airstrike on IS.

However, observers of the live broadcast — including a Wall Street Journal reporter in the country — said that there was no blurring of Mrs. Obama, and that the broadcast showed her shaking hands with King Salman.

The Saudi embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement provided to Bloomberg View, the embassy’s information director said: “Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred.” Various clips posted of the ceremony elsewhere show no blurring of Mrs. Obama or of her handshake with the new king.

The Obamas made a stop in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday on their way back from India to pay respects to the late King Abdullah and to meet with the new leader of a longtime American ally. The visit came amid continued criticism of Saudi Arabia’s policies regarding women’s rights, which served to put the interactions between the first lady and Saudi officials under a spotlight.

Mrs. Obama dressed conservatively, with long pants and long sleeves. The first lady didn’t wear a headscarf in the conservative Muslim country — a standard part of Saudi Arabia’s state-mandated dress code. But covering the head isn’t required for foreigners, though only 3% of Saudis believe that a women without a headscarf is appropriately dressed in public, according to a 2014 study by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research.

Her appearance drew notice on Twitter. Social media users tweeted using an Arabic hashtag that translates to #MichelleObama_NotVeiled.


 


 

Others wondered why she had covered her head on a previous trip, to Indonesia. The photos used were from a 2010 visit to the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta.

In the state of Colorado, cannabis clinics are big industry – earning some retailers nearly $1 million per year.

Those numbers made an impact on the KFC Corporation, they made the decision to include a pot dispensary to be a part of their Colorado franchise restaurants.

Franchisees have the chance to build a foundation into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee.

The KFC Corporation was able to get approval on February 3, 2015 for their Cannabis Retail Recreational Marijuana / Medical Cannabis Occupational Business License.

So far, 42 of the almost 100 KFC franchises that are located in the state Colorado have made this “option”  an addition to their menu.

 Their is actually a humorous comparison due to the south park episode “medicinal fried chicken” having to do with KFC selling marijuana with there famous fried chicken

In the midst of all this a major crisis happens for cartman when his favorite foods at KFC are all replaced with medicinal marijuana stores. Though KFC isn’t going out of business they are adapting to a new trend.

“In order to be successful, a deep understanding of the market is critical to success,” says KFC spokesperson William Rausch. “It’s all about evolution and we are ready to serve the needs of the people of Colorado.”

For the people choosing to buy marijuana they must provide a picture ID showing that they are 21 years or older in order to make a purchase

Coloradans are only allowed to purchase 28 grams at one time, while people who are not citizens of colorado are limited on their purchase only be allowed to buy a quarter at a time

Due to banking restrictions, when making a purchase in dispensaries it is a cash only business . Ounces usually start at a price of 200 and only go up along with a pot tax of 25 %

In addition to making a profit from the “leafy green” they also have some delectable edibles in stock. They are offering Smashed Potatoes, Macaroni Munchies andBong Time Biscuits – all made with their tasty cannabis butter

KFC is anticipating to get all 100 franchisees ready to go with the new inventory by March 2016. #KushForCure

This story was a hoax written by a site which appeared to be the English-language website of the Chinese state-run broadcaster, CCTV. And we fell for it.

The original blog post, which was cited by us and other publishers, was published at cctvnews.cn. The fake site used CCTV’s logo and embedded tweets from the official @CCTVNEWS Twitter account.

The actual URL of CCTV English is english.cntv.cn.

However, an internet directory search shows that the fake CCTVNews site – which is now offline – is based in Hangzhou, 1,300 miles from CCTV’s real headquarters in Beijing.    BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById("update_article_update_time_4429703").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date('2014-12-08 04:28:40 -0500', 'update'); });

This week CCTV News, the state-run broadcaster, came up with these tips for any Chinese people considering an English name – one of which is to steer clear of “Dumbledore”.

It’s common for Chinese people to choose an English name, partly to make conversation with non-Chinese speakers easier. Many Chinese students in western colleges go by an English name, for example.

But as CCTV points out, some people are choosing names that might sound odd to English speakers.

The article says: “While native English speakers are stuck with whatever happy or unhappy names they’ve been given, Chinese and other ‘non-natives’ get the lucky choice of picking their own English name.

“However these choices can mean more than you think!”

Religious, mythical, and fictional characters such as Vampire, Satan, Medusa, and Edward Cullen are a no-no.

“Unique names like these aren’t just very amusing to English speakers, it also suggests you have some connection to that name,” the article warns.

“So if you call yourself Satan, you might get a few foreigners thinking you’re anti-Christian, or possibly a member of a heavy metal band.”

CCTV says Harry is OK, if you’re a Harry Potter fan, but only because it was a common name to start with.

Also on the “no” list are common everyday words that aren’t used as names in English, such as Lawyer.

Other examples include Surprise, Dragon, and Fish – things that might be related to the characters in someone’s Chinese name.

“Sure, have fun and pick a random object or word as a name, but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America.” CCTV says.

CCTV closes the article with this advice for anyone thinking of an English name:

A good way to work out the ‘feeling’ of a name is to watch a bunch of American movies and sitcoms. They’re full of name stereotypes – you’ll find the good girls’ are all ‘Janes’, the jock boys are still ‘Buds’ and the geeks are called ‘Sheldon’.
{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 1281, 'Headline': '400 men cut their testicles off believing it would help them meet God'} | discuss | unrelated | On Thursday evening, thousands of people took to Twitter to share the #MacklemoreJoinedISS, mercilessly trolling the 9/11 truther based on a bogus tweet.

No, Macklemore has not joined the ranks of ISIS.

While the notorious Syria-based terrorist organization has allegedly recruited the likes of Deso Dogg, a Berlin gangsta rapper who’s popped up in a handful of ISIS beheading videos—and is reportedly being used as a recruitment tool—the mild-mannered “Thrift Shop” rapper has not followed suit.

On Thursday evening, the #MacklemoreJoinedISIS became the top trending topic on Twitter worldwide based on the strength of a bogus tweet that was circulated (and retweeted, and retweeted) through the Twitterverse, eventually going viral.

Behold:

horrified at news that macklemore has joined ISIS #MacklemoreJoinedISIS pic.twitter.com/N3PJO0ciWV

The 31-year-old Grammy Award-winning rapper—and recent father—formerly known as Ben Haggerty has supported a number of progressive social causes, including marching in Ferguson protests in his native Seattle and having a bunch of gay couples be married (by Madonna, no less) during his Grammys performance of “Same Love.”

On the opposite end of the sociopolitical spectrum, he's also a 9/11 truther who, on the track “Bush Song” off his 2005 EP The Language of My World, rapped the following: “Where’s Dick Cheney at? Probably off in Iraq / Findin’ some oil to tap, tell ’em I got up on that / And y’all still think it was bin Laden / When it was us and the Masons, plottin’ on oil profits.” The 30-year-old followed those bars up with the following tweet, which he unleashed in 2009:

911...bush knocked down the towers

And back in May, Macklemore took it upon himself to dress up as an anti-Semitic Jewish caricature, sporting a giant prosthetic hooked nose, dark beard, and bowl cut wig, during a surprise performance at Seattle’s Experience Music Project.

The Twitter world, including actor Seth Rogen (who is Jewish), was not amused:

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 1660, 'Headline': 'Jihadi John named as Mohammed Emwazi, from west London'} | discuss | unrelated | Years ago, I had a job in China where I evaluated the spoken English of college students. One bright young woman introduced herself to me with her Chinese name. Then she added: "You can call me 'Easy.' That's my English name."

I paused, thought for a moment, and then decided to say something. "You might want to consider changing your name," I said, explaining—as delicately as possible—that "easy" was an unfortunate name for a woman. Mortified, she thanked me for the tip. "I'm going to go and change my name now," she said.

People in China have adopted English names for decades. Many choose ones that resemble their birth names: Chinese boys named "Da Wei," a common name, almost invariably become "David." Others find inspiration from singers, athletes, politicians, or movie stars. In my first year in China, I taught five different boys called "Tom Hanks," thanks in part to Castaway's success.

Most of the "English" names I encountered were conventional, though others—like the aforementioned "Easy"—were less than appropriate. (I also taught a boy named "Fish" who, perhaps inspired by a certain musical artist, preferred to render his name by drawing it.)

Sweets-inspired names are "typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names."
CCTV, China's state-run broadcaster, wants to solve this problem. In an article published by its English-language channel, the network laid out a series of guidelines for how not to name yourself. For example, avoid naming yourself after a food item ("Candy"), a famous person ("Obama"), or a very old person ("Gertrude"). If you name yourself "Satan," says CCTV, people might think you're anti-Christian, or worse, a "member of a heavy metal band." Proper and traditional names, like "Michael," "William," and "Elizabeth," on the other hand, imply you're from a fancy and conservative family. Sweets-inspired names are "typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names."

One wonders if certain American celebrities might not also benefit from these guidelines. For instance, here's what CCTV has to say about using food as a name:

"Food is very hit or miss. And usually miss. One of the issues here is that food names can be 'very' suggestive."

Gwyneth Paltrow, take note.
{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 1011, 'Headline': 'ISIS Video Claims to Show Beheading of British Hostage'} | discuss | unrelated | WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES. A masked militant claims the murder is in retaliation for American airstrikes against the Islamic State militants in Iraq. Missing since Nov. 22, 2012, Foley appears to be forced to read an anti-American statement before he is beheaded in the gruesome five-minute clip.

An American freelance photojournalist missing since being abducted in Syria some 22 months ago was apparently beheaded by an Islamic State militant in a graphic video released Tuesday.

Titled “A Message to America,” the gruesome clip shows a masked militant saw away at the neck of James Wright Foley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native captured in Binesh, Syria on Thanksgiving Day 2012.

The family, on its "Free James Foley" Facebook page, has yet to confirm his death.

"Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers," the statement reads.

Foley, dressed in orange and kneeling in a desert, reads what appears to be a coerced statement that alludes to recent American airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government. For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” Foley reads as he kneels beside an armed militant, masked and dressed all in black. “My message to my beloved parents: Save me some dignity, and don’t accept some minor compensation for my death from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with their recent aerial campaign in Iraq. I call on my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force: Think about what you are doing. Think about the lives you destroy, including those of your own family … I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.”

The militant, speaking English with what appears to a British accent, threatens America and President Obama, directly after Foley finishes speaking.

“So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people,” the man says, gesturing with a knife he then uses to behead Foley.

The clip begins with a video of President Obama announcing Aug. 7. American intervention in Iraq against the militants.

“Today I authorized two operations in Iraq: targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water, and facing almost certain death,” Obama said in the clip.

The 40-year-old New Hampshire native has been missing since 2012.

James Foley was reporting in the Middle East when abducted.

Foley, 40, is a New Hampshire native. He was reporting in the Middle East when abducted.

Toward the end of the video, the terror group threatens to kill another hostage, Steven Joel Soltoff, a journalist who has contributed to TIME and has been missing since the middle of last year.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the man says as he holds Soltoff by the neck.

The nearly five-minute clip has since been removed from YouTube. It’s unclear where, exactly, the murder was filmed.

The White House, in a statement from National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden, confirmed they "have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley."

"The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity," the statement reads. "If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deppest condolences to his family and friends."

In 2002, Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, 38, was beheaded on video in Pakistan days after being abducted by Al-Qaeda militants.

Taylor Lianne Chandler is Michael Phelps' alleged cougar girlfriend. This was sent to THG directly from a source claiming it's from her. Decide for yourself in this gallery!
Late last week, a tipster contacted The Hollywood Gossip to reveal that Phelps had been with Taylor Lianne Chandler the night of his DUI arrest.

Are they an item? We can't say for certain, but some online sleuthing and a second anonymous email to THG reveal the above photos to be Chandler.

Phelps was reportedly boozing and gambling in a casino for several hours before getting behind the wheel at around double the legal BAC last week.

Our tipster in the Canton area of Batlimore, where Michael lives, claims he is involved with Chandler, a Washington, D.C. resident, on the down-low.

"We saw a blonde model type leaving Michael Phelps' place," our source says, recalling a recent incident in which the two were spotted together.

"She went to the bar across the street, Plug Ugly's, where she was on her phone," says our insider, noting that things weren't going too swimmingly.

Calling and texting and crying at times, she was writing to "Michael" and she said she was in town from Washington for business in crisis management.

She did not seem like she was there on business, however, and was later seen coming out of Michael Phelps' place crying as he put her into a car.

Locals "have seen her many times going into his place in the past few months," the source added, including "the night he was arrested for DUI."

The source describes Taylor as a "tall, swimsuit model type." Cougar would be another word some have used to describe her since this story broke.

It's not clear if Phelps is (or was) still dating Win McMurry, a sportscaster from the Golf Channel, but the dude is clearly losing at life these days.

Phelps is going to rehab, he confirms on Twitter, following his latest arrest, in hopes of focusing on himself and being a better person, et cetera.


Have any tips that could confirm whether something is really going on with these two, or his status with McMurry? Drop us a line and let us know!

He told doctors that his girlfriend had complained about the size of his manhood, which led to him grabbing a razor blade and mutilating himself.

But when the bleeding wouldn't stop, Ilic knew it was time to get some help, so he called emergency services and was taken away in an ambulance. Police discovered the severed organ sitting in the bin, and one five-hour operation later, the penis was reattached.

However, doctors say it's still too early to tell if the surgery was a success, and it remains to be seen if Ilic will regain full use of the organ.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 55, 'Headline': 'KIM JONG-UN NECKS SNAKE WINE FOR VIRILITY'} | discuss | unrelated | FEARS have been raised that Islamic militants have seized a dozen commercial aircraft in an attack on a Libyan airport last week. Now, according to a report, intelligence agencies are warning the jets could be used in 9/11-style attacks.

“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” one official told The Washington Free Beacon this morning.

“We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

The report said intelligence reports distributed within the US government over the past few weeks have detailed the types of aircraft believed seized. Several have the size and range to reach deep into Europe and Africa.

The Beacon reports the analysts as issuing a specific warning — that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack on the date marking the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in the United States.

It is also the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi.

The threat warning comes as dramatic video reveals the final moments of a Libyan combat jet.

The aircraft plunged into the ground less than a kilometre from the country’s parliament during a fly-past intended to honour the pilot of another fighter jet that died in a crash a week ago.

The resulting fireball damaged several nearby buildings.

Libya is witnessing its worst violence since former dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi was toppled and killed in 2011.

The country’s divisions are deeply rooted in rivalries between Islamists and non-Islamists, as well as powerful tribal and regional allegiances between groups that quickly filled the power vacuum after Gaddafi’s was ousted. Successive transitional governments have failed to control the militias.

FIGHTING FLARES UP

Fierce clashes have erupted in recent days over Libya’s eastern city of Benghazi.

Fighting between Islamist militiamen and rival forces loyal to a renegade general killed 31 fighters on both sides, a security official said overnight.

The fighting erupted late on Monday, with forces and fighter jets belonging to General Khalifa Hifter pounding positions of Islamist militias called The Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council, said the official.

The issue of foreign military intervention is one of the most debated in the country. Earlier this month, unknown parties carried out air strikes in Tripoli, bombing Islamist-allied militias’ positions. American officials confirmed reports that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were behind the two air strikes.

The hours-long clashes concentrated around the city’s Benina airport and the militiamen responded with artillery, added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media.

Hifter’s side lost 20 fighters while the militiamen had 11 killed, and 36 fighters in all were wounded, the official said. Several of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition.

Fighting in recent months has mostly engulfed the capital, Tripoli, and also Benghazi, the country’s second-largest city.

The militias in control of the capital, operating under an umbrella group called the Dawn of Libya, have also taken control of the US embassy compound a week after they drove out rival militias.

On Tuesday, Libya’s official news agency said calm had returned to Tripoli, with some banks resuming work and shops and bakeries reopening. Traffic also picked up in the capital and there were long lines outside gas stations. Some families who fled the fighting areas have returned to their homes, the agency said.

POLITICAL CRISIS

On Monday, Libya’s newly elected parliament asked Abdullah al-Thinni — the country’s prime minister who resigned last week — to form a new government. Al-Thinni had said after his resignation that his government had lost control of almost all state institutions and government offices to the armed Islamist militias.

The fighting forced the newly elected parliament and al-Thinni to operate in the eastern city of Tobruk.

On Tuesday, Mohammed Shouaib, the deputy head of parliament, stressed that the body did not ask for “military intervention” but for the United Nations to help Libya build its institutions, including the police and military. He was referring to an earlier decision by the parliament to call for international help in restoring order in Libya.

Shouaib was speaking in a press conference with British envoy Jonathan Powell and British ambassador Michael Aron, who were visiting Tobruk to express support to the elected parliament.

Meanwhile in Tripoli, a parallel government is in the making. Supported by Islamist allies, the so-called National Salvation government led by Omar al-Hassi and his 14-ministers won a vote of confidence. Al-Hassi was appointed by the outgoing parliament — whose mandate expired after a new parliament was elected — and assigned him to form a new government to challenge the legitimate ones in Tobruk.
{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 900, 'Headline': 'Comcast Says You Can Keep Your Tor'} | discuss | unrelated | A hoax story alleging the British graffiti artist Banksy has been arrested and has had his identity revealed has once again duped thousands of people online.

According to the highly refutable website National Report, a 'news' website consisting entirely of fake stories, the artist was arrested by Metropolitan Police at his studio and his identity revealed as 35-year-old Paul Horner, originally from Liverpool.

The article contains all the elements you would expect to see from a news story covering an arrest, including details from police and quotes from those close to Banksy.

However, it only takes the bare minimum of fact-checking and research to spot that this story is a hoax.

The article claims the story has been confirmed by the BBC (it hasn't) and that City of London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy's arrest (he never did and Edwards doesn't even exist).

US news site CNN also did not conduct an interview with Banksy's "project manager" John Hawes following his arrest (also because he doesn't exist).

The 'revealed identity' of Banksy is also suspicious.

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager's house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.

The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics, a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who, unsurprisingly since his previous stories include 'Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month' and 'Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis', has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.

One final, major clue that the story is a hoax is that the exact same thing has happened before. Last February, a fake press release that again claimed Banksy has been arrested and again claimed his name is Paul Horner did the rounds, with Jezebel being one of the more high-profile websites to publish the hoax before later taking it down.

Despite this, the latest 'Banksy arrested' story has been shared more than 200,000 times on Facebook and Twitter, proving there are still people who will believe anything they read on the internet.

"When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened," he said.

"I can do things I couldn't do before but I don't have a lot of control over it," he said.

Nikolai added that he has now decided instead of a fireman he wants to be a superhero when he is older, saying that he would want to do something that helped people, and the job would certainly fulfil that role.

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers, and Nikolai even claims that he seems to be able to share his power.

According to his classmates, he can influence others so that other people turn into live magnets as well.

Nikolai's classmate, Vika Balandina, said: "I could even hang a ladle on my nose."

Stories about "living magnets" began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century.

In 2004, the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as "magnets," many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body.

Only some of them develop a "preference" for a particular material.

In 1990, as many as 300 "living magnets" gathered for a conference in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV.

The woman could hold 7 kilos of metal on a vertical palm.

Scientists say however that rather than people being magnetic, it is probably nothing more than unusually sticky skin.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 1817, 'Headline': "Kim Jong-Un's sister reportedly running N. Korea"} | discuss | unrelated | The FBI is reportedly investigating a new audiotape that allegedly captures the shooting of Michael Brown, according to CNN.

In the tape, you can hear what sounds like at least 10 shots fired, with a significant pause separating the shooting into two segments. CNN's Don Lemon said the news network hasn't confirmed the tape's authenticity. Michael Brown was shot at least six times according to an autopsy.

Lopa Blumenthal, a Missouri-based attorney for the unidentified man who unknowingly captured the shooting while video-chatting with a friend, claimed on CNN that the tape shows that Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson had a "point of contemplation" before firing the final volley of shots.

The man who recorded the audio "was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat," Blumenthal said. "He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building."

"I was very concerned about that pause," she said, "because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up."

It wasn't clear whether Blumenthal had any direct connection to the Brown case.

Retired Chief Deputy U.S. Marshall Matthew Fog, speaking on CNN after hearing the tape, said, "There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern."

The tape appears to have drawn the interest of Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Michael Brown's family. He retweeted a tweet Wednesday night from a CNN viewer that said, "Audio recording of shooting just released. Has been played on CNN by Don Lemon at least 5 xs. Very interesting. Proves alot [sic]."

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 2116, 'Headline': 'Pentagon: ISIS seized materials airdropped to Kurds'} | discuss | unrelated | Online retail giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.98%  plans to open its first brick-and-mortar store, according to people familiar with the plans.

The site, set to open in time for the holiday-shopping season on Manhattan’s busy 34th Street, would mark an experiment by Amazon to connect with customers in the physical world. Amazon has built its business on competitive pricing and fast shipping. Until now, though, it couldn’t compete with the immediacy of a traditional store.

Amazon’s space at 7 West 34th St., across from the Empire State Building in Midtown, would function as a mini-warehouse, with limited inventory for same-day delivery within New York, product returns and exchanges, and pickups of online orders.

Opening a physical location is “about marketing the Amazon brand,” said Matt Nemer, a Wells Fargo analyst. “Same-day delivery, ordering online and picking up in store are ideas that are really catching on. Amazon needs to be at the center of that.”

Amazon also may consider using the space to showcase inventory, particularly its devices like the Kindle e-readers, Fire smartphone or Fire TV set-top box, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking.

Operating stores also carries risks. Until now, Amazon has largely avoided some costs associated with retailing, including leases, paying employees and managing inventory in hundreds of stores. Those expenses could imperil the company’s already thin profit margins.

Some details about the New York store couldn't be learned immediately, including the size, length of the lease or amount of inventory that would be housed there. People familiar with the matter cautioned that Amazon’s plans could change, and that the store is an experiment and could be deemed unsuccessful.

If it is successful, however, the New York location could presage a rollout to other U.S. cities, according to the people familiar with the company’s thinking.

Amazon has studied opening a brick-and-mortar outlet for years, even scouting locations in its hometown Seattle about two years ago before scrapping the idea, said another person familiar with the effort. Amazon once sold Kindles in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. outlets, but those retailers pulled the devices from shelves two years ago in an apparent nod to Amazon’s growing power in retailing.

The 12-story building on 34th Street, owned by Vornado Realty Trust, once housed an Ohrbach’s department store and now has Mango and Express stores at street level. There are two loading docks at the back of the building.

The Amazon store will be in the shadow of the Empire State Building, which last year attracted 4.3 million visitors to its observatory. It is a block east of Herald Square, where Macy’s Inc. flagship store draws more than 20 million annual visitors, according to the 34th Street Partnership, a business-improvement district.

“Foot traffic on 34th Street is unparalleled,” said Chase Welles, executive vice president at SCG Retail, a real-estate service company.

The streetscape of 34th Street has changed dramatically since the 1990s, when it was populated by low-end retailers. Since then, the business-improvement district and area companies have spent about $2 billion on upgrades to the neighborhood and individual properties, according to the 34th Street Partnership. Global and national retailers such as Zara, Uniqlo and Vince Camuto have opened stores on the street.

Vornado Chief Financial Officer Stephen Theriot hailed the 34th Street building on a recent conference call with analysts. “As a former department store, it’s got very high ceilings, it is got big, open floor plates, and that’s the type of property that a lot of the creative class tenants” favor, he said.


Amazon has studied opening a brick-and-mortar outlet for years, even scouting locations in its hometown Seattle about two years ago before scrapping the idea. Bloomberg
Ordering online with the option to pick up in stores has proved popular; retailers including Wal-Mart, Home Depot Inc. and Macy’s, offer the service. Others employ delivery services such as Google Inc., eBay Inc. or startup Deliv Inc. to fetch orders from stores, rather than warehouses, and bring them to customers.

Amazon has experimented with physical stores before, including pop-up shops and locations run by subsidiaries. Last November, Kindle-brand pop-ups appeared in U.S. malls, selling e-readers and tablets from vending machines. Its Zappos unit has a store near its Kentucky distribution center and once operated a few outlets in its hometown Las Vegas; and its Quidsi unit runs a cosmetics store in Manhasset, N.Y.

Amazon also has set up large metal lockers in convenience stores and parking garages around the country, to accommodate deliveries and returns. The lockers don’t offer same-day delivery, however. The lockers have been a popular option and Amazon has expanded them to a number of cities, including overseas, after initially just offering them in Seattle.

Amazon took some inspiration from a trial by the U.K.’s Home Retail Group PLC, allowing customers to order eBay goods online and pick them up in its Argos stores, said one person familiar with Amazon’s thinking. By year’s end Argos expects to provide the service at 650 stores from 65,000 eBay sellers.

Other primarily online retailers have opened physical storefronts, including clothier Bonobos Inc., eyeglasses purveyor Warby Parker, and subscription beauty-products service Birchbox.

New York-based Bonobos opened its first of 10 retail stores in 2011; it plans 40 by 2016, said Chief Executive Andy Dunn. The stores offer limited inventory so customers can determine their size and choose styles and patterns; the merchandise is then shipped to their home from a warehouse, or can be collected later in-store.

Mr. Dunn said customers who order clothing from Bonobos brick-and-mortar stores spend roughly twice as much as online shoppers.

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Vice founder Shane Smith recently balled out exceptionally hard on a dinner for a group of 12 at the Prime Steakhouse in Las Vegas, racking up a $300,000 check.

A source at Vice told BuzzFeed News that Smith won a sum “well north of that bill” while gambling during his week at the CES conference in Las Vegas, and paid for the dinner on his personal credit card. (A Financial Times report says Smith won $1 million; both the FT and New York Times say there were about 30 people eating on Smith’s dime.)

Smith himself hasn’t commented on the story, which is a pity, because the world needs to know the answer to a crucial question: How can you spend $300,000 on dinner?

Short of a how-to guide from the man himself, or a member of his $2.5 billion digital media empire, we’re left to speculate. So in that spirit, we checked out the menu at Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino. Here’s our best guess of how Smith and a party of 12 could have racked up a tab the value of a single-family home.

Here’s your check, whenever you’re ready…

Prime’s Siberian Sturgeon Caviar with traditional accompaniments was likely a must for Smith’s group. The restaurant lists the item as market price, but Eater Las Vegas has it going for up to $2,500 per pound. A couple pounds of caviar seems reasonable.

ALLEKO/ALLEKO

Mercifully for Smith, Prime doesn’t put its wine list online. But just down the strip at Mario Batali’s Carnevino in the Wynn, a few bottles of Dom Perignon (2003) will run guests $400 each.

Jay L. Clendenin/Los Angeles Times / MCT

But what are we, farmers? Any respectable internet baron is going to spring for a couple of bottles of the best champagne in the house. At Batali’s joint, a 1.5-liter bottle of Boërl & Kroff 1998 will set you back $15,000 each.

AntonMatveev/AntonMatveev

Obviously white wine accompanies any good foodie’s fish course. Smith’s crew could have grabbed a couple bottles of the $9,000 Montrachet, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti from 2007. An average year, but sometimes compromise is necessary.

Manakin/Manakin

For the reds, perhaps a couple of vintages on the more reasonable side, like the $5,000 per bottle Sine Qua Non “Just for the Love of It” 2002 Syrah.

Agents from Keller Williams Realty had gathered for a regional conference, but decided to surprise the delivery guy, identified only as Rob, with a random act of kindness in the form of a massive tip for which they had all pitched in.

Brian LeFevre, delivery manager at Ann Arbor’s Pizza House, told the AP that Rob was “ecstatic” with his big tip.

{'Stance': 'agree', 'Body ID': 1017, 'Headline': 'White House Fence-Jumper Overpowered Secret Service Officer, Ran Through Much of Main Floor'} | discuss | agree | WASHINGTON — A man who scaled a White House fence this month and breached the mansion's front door apparently rushed past a Secret Service agent inside and was stopped only after reaching the building's East Room, a government official confirmed Monday.

New details of the incident involving Omar Gonzalez, who allegedly penetrated the mansion deeper than was previously known, were first reported Monday by The Washington Post.

The government official, who is not authorized to comment publicly about the incident, did not dispute the contents of the Post account.

Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan, citing an ongoing investigation, declined to comment on the report.

The disclosure comes as Secret Service Director Julia Pierson prepares to testify Tuesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Pierson is likely to address the Gonzalez incident, along with a shooting incident in 2011 which, according to a separate Post report, the Secret Service failed to recognize as an attack on the White House until days after discovering damage left by multiple rounds fired by a high-powered rifle.

In the more recent incident, Gonzalez reportedly overpowered a Secret Service officer and ran through the main floor.

An alarm box near the front entrance apparently had been muted.

Gonzalez, who was armed with a knife, allegedly made it into the East Room before he was taken down by an agent.

The fence-jumping incident and the delayed reporting of the White House shooting in 2011 represent the latest in a series of missteps by the elite protective service.

This year, three agents were sent home from the Netherlands before a presidential trip after one of the agents was discovered intoxicated in a hotel hallway.

That episode followed a well-publicized incident in 2012 in Cartagena, Colombia, when Secret Service agents and other U.S. authorities brought escorts back to a hotel after a night of heavy drinking.
{'Stance': 'disagree', 'Body ID': 1971, 'Headline': 'SEE IT: California homeless man uses $100 gift to give food to others'} | discuss | disagree | HUNTINGTON BEACH (CBSLA.com)  —  The viral video of a homeless man buying food for friends with $100 he had been given warmed the hearts of many of the more than 25 million people who clicked on it.
Donations came pouring in for the homeless man named Thomas. More than $130,000 donated from around the globe in about a week.
Josh Paler Lin, the YouTube personality who uploaded the nearly five-minute video, is telling everyone within earshot that the heartwarming viral video is real.
The homeless man’s brother, however, said that his brother is being scammed. Meanwhile, an eyewitness to the filming also believes the entire thing is a hoax.
The eyewitness told CBS2’s Stacey Butler that he saw Thomas in Lin’s car when Lin purported the man didn’t know he was being filmed. During the video, Lin can be heard telling his shooter, “Make sure he doesn’t see you.”
The homeless man’s brother also spoke to Butler.
In the video,  the homeless man is tracked to a convenience store that sold liquor. He buys food for other homeless people with the $100 he was given by Lin.
Lin later confronts the man and gives him another $100 because he said he assumed he was going to buy alcohol with the money and he couldn’t believe he was so generous with his friends.
In another eight-minute video, Lin takes Thomas out for a couple of meals, including shabu-shabu on Christmas Eve, provides him with a hotel room and a surprise makeover. Lin insists none of the videos were staged or scripted.
With hits to his YouTube channel (he joined in 2009), it’s already estimated that Lin made $52,000, not counting the Indiegogo fundraising  page he said he set up for Thomas. Lin’s channel also gained him nearly 15,000 new fans.
Critics have already pointed out that Thomas would have had to have walked  for at least 34 minutes to the Liquor Mart, passing cheaper supermarkets along the way. They also point out that a homeless and begging Thomas had a rather blase reaction for someone who had just received $100 from a stranger.
The eyewitness to the filming told Butler he knew Lin from his many prankster videos and said he definitely saw Thomas in Lin’s vehicle during set-ups.
“I was there,” says Taugan Kadalim, “they didn’t ‘follow’ him. They drove him there [to the liquor store.]
Kadalim believes Thomas, 56, is really homeless but that the entire video was staged.
“I think the manner in how they portrayed the entire video is deceitful,” Kadalim says, “And dishonest.”
Thomas’ brother, Kevin Nickel, reached out to CBS2.
“This isn’t right,” he said.
“In a surprising twist,” Butler reported, “he says his brother’s real name is Kenny Nickel. He said his brother is an alcoholic and lived with their parents until both died last summer.”
He said his brother was arrested for public intoxication and put in jail. Butler was unable to confirm his arrest record.
His brother also says Kenny is actually not broke. He is due $150,000 from his parents’ estate.
“He’s sitting on money,” Kevin said, not sure if his brother is even aware of the Indiegogo money being collected on his behalf. “But this is a scam. This money needs to go to people who really need it.”
Kevin fears his brother is being manipulated and that if he does get the money he uses it to get help.
{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 47, 'Headline': 'Fidel Castro Is Dead, According to Viral Twitter Rumors'} | discuss | unrelated | After campaigning on a promise to reform stop-and-frisk, Mayor Bill de Blasio is set to launch his most significant effort to address the issues raised by the policy. Law-enforcement officials tell the New York Times that soon the NYPD may issue tickets for low-level marijuana possession rather than making arrests. Under the de Blasio administration's planned changes to the city's marijuana policy, those caught with a small amount of weed would be issued a court summons, but avoid a trip to the police station. The shift could have a huge impact in black and Latino communities, as a recent study found those groups represented 86 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city this year.

The de Blasio administration is still working out the details, such as how much weed one could possess without triggering an arrest, and some are already unhappy with the proposed change. Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson, who announced this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana possession cases, said that telling people to show up in a court room without arresting them may actually be worse for minorities.

"In order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system, these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review," Thompson explained. "By allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place. These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred."

In other words, don't expect the debate about how NYPD officers should proceed when they catch someone with a joint to be resolved anytime soon.
{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 1273, 'Headline': "Texas plumber's truck on front line of Syria war"} | discuss | unrelated | WOBURN, Mass. (AP) — A 113-year-old, shoebox-sized time capsule was removed Thursday from the head of a lion statue where it had long sat, hidden in plain sight, atop one of Boston's most famous landmarks.

When the copper box was carefully pried open, it revealed at least one mystery: a red, hardcover book with no visible title or markings. The contents of the book — and the rest of the items in the box — will remain a mystery for a bit longer, as they were deemed too fragile to remove immediately.

The time capsule's presence at the Old State House had only recently been confirmed. The Bostonian Society, which oversees the building, had expected it to contain a potpourri of photographs and newspaper clippings from the period, along with a missive to future generations penned by a group of Boston journalists.

"I'm absolutely delighted by the conditions inside the box," said Brian LeMay, the society's president, noting little sign of mold or water damage. Historians had feared the contents could have been destroyed had the box been improperly sealed.

The time capsule was placed inside the lion's head in 1901 and then forgotten, even as waves of tourists visited the building that once served as a fulcrum of British rule in the northern colonies and later as the first seat of Massachusetts state government.

In 1770, British soldiers opened fire on a crowd of protesters outside the building, killing five in what came to be known as the Boston Massacre.

The society first learned of the possible existence of the time capsule three years ago from the great-great-granddaughter of Samuel Rogers, a craftsman who had worked on renovations to the building and was believed to have placed the box in the lion's head and catalogued its contents. A 1901 article from The Boston Globe surfaced later, alluding to contents of a copper box "which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence."

The box was removed Thursday by Robert Shure, president of Skylight Studios in suburban Woburn, where the copper and gold-leaf lion statue had been brought for refurbishing.

Shure placed the box on a table and used a drill and other tools to cut it open. The bright red book was the first object seen inside.

Elizabeth Roscio, archivist for the Bostonian Society, speculated that the book could be a Rogers' family history, but LeMay was less certain.

"I'm as anxious as anyone in this room to just grab it and look inside," he said. But Roscio explained that to avoid possible damage, the contents must be removed and examined in a temperature-controlled setting. They could go on public display at the Old State House later this year.

In accepting the gift from the past, the society has also decided to leave one for the future.

A new time capsule, made of titanium, will be inserted back into the head of the lion. Suggestions on what to include are still being solicited, LeMay said, but one item will be a medal from the 2013 Boston Marathon, a symbol to future generations of the city's resiliency in the face of tragedy.

It quotes several journalists from within Saudi Arabia covering the event, adding that the State TV in fact did not blur the face of the First Lady anyway.

According to Nail al-Jubeir, information director at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, the blurring isn’t real.

“Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred.”

CNN correspondent Hala Gorani also tweeted out that the Saudi TV in fact did not blur Michelle Obama’s face.

Our Nic Robertson in Riyadh telling me footage he saw on Saudi TV did not show a blurred Michelle Obama. On that note, Good night Twitter!

— Hala Gorani (@HalaGorani) January 27, 2015

Original Story:

U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama might have found it apt to cut short their trip to India to pay homage to former Saudi King Abdullah, who passed away last week. The Saudis, however, don’t seem to be enamored by the presence of the First Lady in their country.

According to a report by Bloomberg, the Saudi state television allegedly blurred out the face of Michelle Obama during a brief televised meeting between the new Saudi King Salman and the President at Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. In fact, the new King reportedly refused to acknowledge the presence of the First Lady and did not say hello or shake hands with her, the report adds. Other media houses from the Middle East, however, showed the unedited footage of the meeting without obscuring the face of Michelle Obama.

Hours after the state TV ran those clips, several of them were posted to Facebook, reports the Washington Times. However, most of the videos were subsequently taken down — probably at the behest of Saudi’s Internet Police. A version of the clip is now up on YouTube. We are unsure, however, how long it would remain there. We have managed to capture a screenshot of the video, just in case. The video is embedded below.

Meanwhile, Michelle Obama also faced criticism from some Arab media outlets for her decision to wear blue on her visit. They added that the First Lady should have worn a black dress, which is more appropriate for a funeral. Also pertinent to note was the fact that Michelle Obama did not wear a head scarf during the time she was out in public. As per Saudi law, all women in the country, even visitors, are required by law to wear a head scarf while in public. This is perhaps why the state TV blurred the First Lady out entirely.

There is also talk about the new Saudi King insulting Barack Obama by breaking protocol. The new King apparently abruptly turned around and walked away from the President in order to go for a prayer. This, however, could have been due to the inexperience of the new King, others allege.

Later in the day, the Saudi King held bilateral talks with other senior staff, including Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator John McCain, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Ambassador Joseph Westphal, and CIA director John Brennan. A statement by the White House later announced the following.

“Obama and Salman sat in gold chairs. A small table in front of them held a spray of white flowers.”

The alleged decision by the Saudi state television to blur the face of Michelle Obama once again raises the question of women’s rights in Saudi Arabia. The country has strict laws that restrict freedom of movement of women. In fact, it was only recently that the country gave womenfolk the right to vote. It is also the only country in the world where women are not allowed to drive. Now, with even the wife of the world’s most powerful man being targeted, albeit indirectly, the world is certain to take note.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 1817, 'Headline': "Is Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo Jong in charge?"} | discuss | unrelated | The FBI is reportedly investigating a new audiotape that allegedly captures the shooting of Michael Brown, according to CNN.

In the tape, you can hear what sounds like at least 10 shots fired, with a significant pause separating the shooting into two segments. CNN's Don Lemon said the news network hasn't confirmed the tape's authenticity. Michael Brown was shot at least six times according to an autopsy.

Lopa Blumenthal, a Missouri-based attorney for the unidentified man who unknowingly captured the shooting while video-chatting with a friend, claimed on CNN that the tape shows that Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson had a "point of contemplation" before firing the final volley of shots.

The man who recorded the audio "was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat," Blumenthal said. "He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building."

"I was very concerned about that pause," she said, "because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up."

It wasn't clear whether Blumenthal had any direct connection to the Brown case.

Retired Chief Deputy U.S. Marshall Matthew Fog, speaking on CNN after hearing the tape, said, "There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern."

The tape appears to have drawn the interest of Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Michael Brown's family. He retweeted a tweet Wednesday night from a CNN viewer that said, "Audio recording of shooting just released. Has been played on CNN by Don Lemon at least 5 xs. Very interesting. Proves alot [sic]."

{'Stance': 'agree', 'Body ID': 1978, 'Headline': 'Robert Plant Literally Ripped Up An $800 Million Contract To Reunite Led Zeppelin'} | discuss | agree | A Led Zeppelin reunion tour, backed by an astonishing amount of money put up by British billionaire Richard Branson, will never happen — because singer Robert Plant ripped up a contract that would have paid him about $300 million to play 35 concerts with the the legendary band in just three cities.

The information about the aborted Led Zeppelin reunion tour came from an exclusive report in Britain’s Daily Mirror newspaper, which said that the 66-year-old Plant — who during the 1970s heyday of Zeppelin was one of the world’s most successful and recognizable rock stars — simply didn’t believe it was “the right thing to do.”

“They have tried to talk him round but there is no chance,” said an anonymous source said by The Mirror to be close to Robert Plant. “His mind is made up and that’s that.”

According to the Mirror story, the other two surviving members of Led Zeppelin — guitarist Jimmy Page, 70, and 68-year-old bass player/musical arranger John Paul Jones — had already signed their mega-contracts and were ready to set out on the tour, which would have taken them to London’s O2 Arena as well as Berlin and New Jersey.

But Plant just wasn’t into it.

Jason Bonham, the 48-year-old son of original Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, has also signed on to play drums as a salaried musician on the Zep reunion tour.

Led Zeppelin formed in 1968 and were considered the biggest rock act in the world through the early and mid-1970s. But they broke up in 1980 after John Bonham died in his sleep at age 32 following a heavy drinking binge.

Jason Bonham played drums with Led Zeppelin for the band’s one-off reunion performance during the Ahmet Ertugun Tribute Concert in 2007. Ertugun was the record label boss who signed Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records, sight unseen, launching the then-unknown band’s meteoric career.

Branson, according to the Mirror, guaranteed the band more than $900 million to be split among the three original members, for the proposed Led Zeppelin reunion tour.

Plant’s share alone would have nearly tripled his current, already-formidable net worth, which is reported at $170 million.

According to the Mirror’s source, Page, Jones, and Bonham were stunned by Plant’s refusal to take part in the tour.

“It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it. When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock,” The Mirror quotes the source as saying. “There is no way they can go ahead without him.”

Led Zeppelin fans can still get their dose of the legendary band through an ongoing series of remastered reissues of the original Led Zeppelin albums, a project being coordinated by Page.

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Vice founder Shane Smith recently balled out exceptionally hard on a dinner for a group of 12 at the Prime Steakhouse in Las Vegas, racking up a $300,000 check.

A source at Vice told BuzzFeed News that Smith won a sum “well north of that bill” while gambling during his week at the CES conference in Las Vegas, and paid for the dinner on his personal credit card. (A Financial Times report says Smith won $1 million; both the FT and New York Times say there were about 30 people eating on Smith’s dime.)

Smith himself hasn’t commented on the story, which is a pity, because the world needs to know the answer to a crucial question: How can you spend $300,000 on dinner?

Short of a how-to guide from the man himself, or a member of his $2.5 billion digital media empire, we’re left to speculate. So in that spirit, we checked out the menu at Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino. Here’s our best guess of how Smith and a party of 12 could have racked up a tab the value of a single-family home.

Prime’s Siberian Sturgeon Caviar with traditional accompaniments was likely a must for Smith’s group. The restaurant lists the item as market price, but Eater Las Vegas has it going for up to $2,500 per pound. A couple pounds of caviar seems reasonable.

ALLEKO/ALLEKO

Mercifully for Smith, Prime doesn’t put its wine list online. But just down the strip at Mario Batali’s Carnevino in the Wynn, a few bottles of Dom Perignon (2003) will run guests $400 each.

Jay L. Clendenin/Los Angeles Times / MCT

But what are we, farmers? Any respectable internet baron is going to spring for a couple of bottles of the best champagne in the house. At Batali’s joint, a 1.5-liter bottle of Boërl & Kroff 1998 will set you back $15,000 each.

AntonMatveev/AntonMatveev

Obviously white wine accompanies any good foodie’s fish course. Smith’s crew could have grabbed a couple bottles of the $9,000 Montrachet, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti from 2007. An average year, but sometimes compromise is necessary.

Manakin/Manakin

For the reds, perhaps a couple of vintages on the more reasonable side, like the $5,000 per bottle Sine Qua Non “Just for the Love of It” 2002 Syrah.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 900, 'Headline': 'Alleged Audio of Michael Brown Shooting Doesn’t Sound Good for Officer Darren Wilson'} | discuss | unrelated | A hoax story alleging the British graffiti artist Banksy has been arrested and has had his identity revealed has once again duped thousands of people online.

According to the highly refutable website National Report, a 'news' website consisting entirely of fake stories, the artist was arrested by Metropolitan Police at his studio and his identity revealed as 35-year-old Paul Horner, originally from Liverpool.

The article contains all the elements you would expect to see from a news story covering an arrest, including details from police and quotes from those close to Banksy.

However, it only takes the bare minimum of fact-checking and research to spot that this story is a hoax.

The article claims the story has been confirmed by the BBC (it hasn't) and that City of London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy's arrest (he never did and Edwards doesn't even exist).

US news site CNN also did not conduct an interview with Banksy's "project manager" John Hawes following his arrest (also because he doesn't exist).

The 'revealed identity' of Banksy is also suspicious.

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager's house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.

The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics, a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who, unsurprisingly since his previous stories include 'Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month' and 'Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis', has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.

One final, major clue that the story is a hoax is that the exact same thing has happened before. Last February, a fake press release that again claimed Banksy has been arrested and again claimed his name is Paul Horner did the rounds, with Jezebel being one of the more high-profile websites to publish the hoax before later taking it down.

Despite this, the latest 'Banksy arrested' story has been shared more than 200,000 times on Facebook and Twitter, proving there are still people who will believe anything they read on the internet.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 2525, 'Headline': "US officials: Video shows American's execution"} | discuss | unrelated | Oh Internet, when will you ever stop killing perfectly healthy celebrities, or at least those that are healthy enough to be alive? Today, one of those ridiculously stupid and fake-looking hoax sites that generates random celebrity death stories once again proved that people are gullible and should have to take IQ tests to use the Internet. Looking like an MSNBC page that stopped loading in 2004, the farticle (that’s my name for these fake articles) claimed that sources were “reporting” that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose was found dead yesterday from unknown causes in his West Hollywood home.

“The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area,” read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large, Dorito-speckled smirk on his face. While plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on Facebook and Twitter, the sleuths at Gossip Cop quickly proved that it was fake. Probably by looking at it.

The awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”

Enough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website. (Via Gossip Cop)

One of these days, Rose might actually pass away and then none of us will believe it because of these stupid hoax reports. And then his funeral will be really sad when it starts raining and Slash plays a guitar solo with no shirt under his leather jacket on top of Rose’s casket, and nobody’s there to appreciate it.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 808, 'Headline': 'Star Wars VII for a New SUMMER Release Date!?'} | discuss | unrelated | A Catholic priest from Massachusetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.
Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.

“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.

The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, made a public statement this morning stating that Father O’neal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isn’t a female.

According to an attorney for an unidentified man who lives in an apartment building near the site of the shooting, the recording captures as many as 11 shots fired in the Aug. 9 incident.

The audio, which was played on CNN Monday night, could not immediately be verified by The Washington Post. But a burst of gunfire can be heard (six shots), followed by a pause, and then several more shots (at least four).

“He was in his apartment, he was talking to a friend on a video chat, he heard loud noises and at the moment — at the time he didn’t realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,” the man’s lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, said in an interview with CNN’s Don Lemon. “It just happened to capture 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.”

According to Blumenthal, FBI agents came to her office on Monday to interview the man about the recording.

The 12 second-audio clip is the only using a cell-phone app that only records short excerpts of a video conversation. It captured nothing before the shots began and nothing after. The man, who would like to remain anonymous, has asked that the accompanying video not be shown, Blumenthal said in an interview with The Post.

She first learned of the audio clip through the man’s roommate, who is a former client, and she urged him to share it with authorities.

“He was there when the event happened,” Blumenthal said, adding that he initially assumed the noise was fireworks not gunshots. “He is a very private person and he his not seeking publicity of any kind whatsoever. He was even unaware that this tape was relevant to anyone.”

Neither Ferguson nor St. Louis County police have contacted the man or Blumenthal about the video. After interviewing him on Monday, she said the FBI indicated that they planned to speak with him again on Tuesday.

Autopsy reports conducted by St. Louis County and by the Brown family found that Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

There was an unexpected crash landing near the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital over the weekend, but luckily no one was hurt: A small meteor, thought to have broken off from an Earth-passing asteroid, left a 40-foot-wide crater.

The meteorite — which experts say may have disintegrated on impact — smashed through a wooded area outside the airport in Managua, leaving a 16-foot-deep hole.

"We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave," Jorge Santamaria, a resident in the area of the impact, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying.

The AP quotes Nicaraguan government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo as saying the meteorite was relatively small and "appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth."

Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened, the AP says.

"All the evidence that we've confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event," Ineter scientist Jose Millan was quoted by the BBC as saying. "We have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact."

According to the BBC:

The asteroid was discovered on Aug. 31 by the Catalina Sky Survey near Tucson, Ariz., and independently detected the next night by the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope, located on the summit of Haleakala on Maui, Hawaii, according to a NASA statement issued last week.

The statement said that on closest approach, the asteroid was to have been one-tenth the distance from the center of the Earth to the moon, or about 25,000 miles, away.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 2167, 'Headline': "[UPDATED] 11 Men and 0 Women on Tonight's ESPN Domestic Violence Panel"} | discuss | unrelated | (Reuters) - A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious ruling forbidding the building of snowmen, described them as anti-Islamic.

Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country's north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied: "It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun."

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

"God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on," he wrote in his ruling.

That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.

"They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds," one Twitter user wrote.

Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a "snow bride" wearing a bra and lipstick. "The reason for the ban is fear of sedition," he wrote.

A third said the country was plagued by two types of people:

"A people looking for a fatwa (religious ruling) for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa," the user wrote.

Sheikh Munajjid had some supporters, however. "It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism," one wrote.

"May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognize matters that even Satan does not think about."

Snow has covered upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia's border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East.

Kashmira Gander writes for the Independent and Independent on Sunday

Monday 08 September 2014

Experts from across the world are attempting to understand whether a mysterious bang heard in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua on Saturday night was caused by a meteorite which broke off from a passing asteroid.

Baffled residents of the Central American city told reporters that they heard a loud boom at around 11pm, but did not see anything shoot across the sky. Meanwhile, scientists are uncertain whether the now missing rock disintegrated or shot deep into the ground.

"I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave," Jorge Santamaria told reporters.

Jose Millan, from the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter), said residents of the capital had made a lucky escape as no one was injured.

"We need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population," he said.

A committee formed to investigate the incident have confirmed that the noise was caused by a “relatively small” meteorite that fell from an asteroid passing close to Earth, said Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo.

She added that international experts have been called upon to help local scientists understand the situation and its possible links to the "Pitbull" asteroid.

Meanwhile, Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the institute of territorial studies, said it was "very strange that no one reported a streak of light."

"We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something," he said.

A Nicaraguan soldier checking the crater  The meteorite left a crater with a radius 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet near Managua's international airport and an air force base, said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan institute of territorial studies who took part in the investigation.

It is yet unclear whether the meteorite disintegrated on impact or became buried, he added.

Humberto Garcia, of the astronomy centre at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to Pitbull.

"We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock," he said.

Two Nicaraguan soldiers guard the crater  Meanwhile, British scientist Dr Dan Brown said he agreed that the crater may be linked to the Pitbull, or 2014 RC, asteroid, but said this was not the only solution.

The astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, said: “Although the impact occurred roughly 12 hours before the asteroid passed Earth, that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it.

"If it was an unrelated object, however, then it further demonstrates how we don't really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there," he suggested.

Echoing the confusion of Nicaraguan residents and experts, he continued: "It certainly makes absolute sense that people surrounding the impact site heard a loud boom - but a flash of light or bright object should also have been observed before that.

"Further analysis will hopefully help to establish this and possibly give a better indication of the object's trajectory. It is still to be seen if any material of the meteorite can be recovered.

"Both pieces of evidence would make it possible to link it to 2014 RC and help us understand more about asteroids," he said.

"I'm going to go and change my name now," she said.

People in China have adopted English names for decades. Many choose ones that resemble their birth names: Chinese boys named "Da Wei," a common name, almost invariably become "David." Others find inspiration from singers, athletes, politicians, or movie stars. In my first year in China, I taught five different boys called "Tom Hanks," thanks in part to Castaway's success.

Most of the "English" names I encountered were conventional, though others—like the aforementioned "Easy"—were less than appropriate. (I also taught a boy named "Fish" who, perhaps inspired by a certain musical artist, preferred to render his name by drawing it.)

Sweets-inspired names are "typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names."
CCTV, China's state-run broadcaster, wants to solve this problem. In an article published by its English-language channel, the network laid out a series of guidelines for how not to name yourself. For example, avoid naming yourself after a food item ("Candy"), a famous person ("Obama"), or a very old person ("Gertrude"). If you name yourself "Satan," says CCTV, people might think you're anti-Christian, or worse, a "member of a heavy metal band." Proper and traditional names, like "Michael," "William," and "Elizabeth," on the other hand, imply you're from a fancy and conservative family. Sweets-inspired names are "typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names."

One wonders if certain American celebrities might not also benefit from these guidelines. For instance, here's what CCTV has to say about using food as a name:

"Food is very hit or miss. And usually miss. One of the issues here is that food names can be 'very' suggestive."

Gwyneth Paltrow, take note.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 381, 'Headline': 'Boko Haram denies truce, says kidnapped girls married'} | discuss | unrelated | “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2015 that is scheduled to be released during winter. The latest reports, however, claim that J.J. Abrams, the director of the seventh episode of the epic space opera, wants an early release date for his movie.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is currently scheduled to be released on Dec. 18, 2015. Based on YouTuber Votesaxon 07’s video, Movie Pilot reports that J.J. Abrams wants to release “Episode 7” in the summer of 2015. The report by the aforementioned entertainment news publication claims that the 48-year-old director made the announcement at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015.

The publication claims that the reason why J.J. Abrams wants to release “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” almost six months before its scheduled date is the alleged plot and images leaks from the sets and script. The moviemaker is now worried that these plot leaks will make the film “predictable and not worth watching” for the audience.

According to the website, moving the release date forward would be “an extremely brave move,” putting it up against other fan-favourite releases such as “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Jurassic World” and “Ant-Man.” However, shifting the release date means a lot of work for the moviemakers and the studio. Meanwhile, Ikwiz reports that Disney is “seriously” considering J.J. Abrams' demand of summer release of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

Fans must note that these reports lack official comments from the associated parties; thus, the information must be taken with a pinch of salt. However, fans know that Disney is seriously dealing with the issue of image leak. Recently, the studio issued a subpoena over the leak of images from “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

In additional news, J.J. Abrams finally broke his silence on the controversy over the new lightsaber that debuted in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” trailer. Speaking to Collider at a Hollywood event, the director admitted receiving tons of emails arguing about the new lightsaber and its functionality.

"It's been the funniest thing to see the arguments that have developed over this thing,” J.J Abrams said. "This was not done without a lot of conversation. It's fun to see people have the conversation that we had, but in reverse,” the director explained.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” features John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, Harrison For as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, and Domhnall Gleeson, Max von Sydow and Adam Driver, all in unspecified roles. Stay tuned for more updates.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 2091, 'Headline': 'US Marine survives headshot in Afghanistan'} | discuss | unrelated | The Department of Homeland Security has received serious and credible information indicating that an extremist splinter group of Al Qaeda, now going by the name Bhakkar Fatwa, is planning multiple attacks against American consumers as they wait in line for stores to open on November 28th: the day known as Black Friday.

Bhakkar Fatwa is a small, relatively unknown group of Islamic militants and fanatics that originated in Bhakkar Pakistan as the central leadership of Al Qaeda disintegrated under the pressures of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and drone strikes conducted around the world. The group has since branched out and begun aggressively recruiting throughout the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Within the last year the group has come under increased scrutiny by both the CIA and the Department of Homeland Security as they have begun actively recruiting on American soil.

Jeh Johnson, Director of the Department of Homeland Security, has referred to Bhakkar Fatwa as the number one growing problem on the domestic terrorism front in America. Their presence is felt in many mosques and islamic centers across the country: always quietly and out of sight, and previously without any violent operations. Officials at both the CIA and Homeland Security think that may be about to change.

Jack Phillips, agent in charge of monitoring Bhakkar Fatwa’s American operation detailed the agencies recent findings. “Working with both the CIA and the NSA we were able to access conversations and communications between members of Bhakkar Fatwa’s domestic organization and their leadership in Pakistan which indicate that several attacks are planned against American citizens at retail operations on the 28th of November”, said Phillips. “The instructions sent from Pakistan detailed a broad plan of attacks using both firearms and homemade explosives against large crowds gathered outside of stores waiting for the sales that have become the hallmark of the day. The leadership of Bhakkar Fatwa views the American religion as one worshiping money and possessions. They commanded these attacks as being against the ‘holiest temples’ that the Americans serve.”

“We have taken several actions based off of this information”, stated Phillips. “We have detained three individuals who were in active communication with Pakistani leadership regarding these planned terror attacks. All three are undergoing interrogation as we speak so that we may hopefully determine the scope and extent of attacks that have been planned. The names of those detained will not be immediately released. They have been deemed enemy combatants and releasing their identities could impact our operational ability at this point. Everything conceivable is being done to unmask and deal with this new threat.”

“If you are going out shopping early on Friday please keep your eyes open”, Phillips advised. ” At this juncture we are unsure as to how great the threat from these attacks is going to be. We are working as quickly as we can to resolve this situations, but this terrorist group is savvy. They utilize a small closed cell structure, and we may not be able to identify all of them in time. I urge all Americans to strongly consider whether the sales are worth the risk. And if you do go out take particular caution while waiting in line for the store to open. Intelligence points to the time spent waiting outside of the store as the time of greatest vulnerability. I am sure we will resolve this issue, but I still recommend taking adequate precautions.”

C'est ce qu'affirme le père John Micheal O’neal, prêtre de 71 ans dans le Massachusetts. Le 29 janvier dernier, il est amené d’urgence à l’hôpital, victime d'une crise cardiaque. Quelques minutes après son arrivée, il est déclaré cliniquement mort. Les médecins parviennent finalement à le «ramener à la vie en redémarrant son cœur, 48 minutes après qu’il s’est arrêté, rapportent plusieurs médias américains.
Le religieux américain a prétendu avoir des souvenirs clairs de ce qui lui était arrivé pendant ces longues minutes de mort clinique. Il explique avoir eu la sensation d’être sorti de son corps, entouré par une lumière écrasante, et éprouvé un sentiment d’intense amour autour de lui. Des sensations souvent évoquées par ceux qui ont fait l’expérience de mort imminente (EMI).

Mais John Micheal O’neal va plus loin. Il affirme être monté au ciel et avoir rencontré le Tout-puissant. Celui-ci serait un «être de lumière», mais surtout, une «figure maternelle chaleureuse et réconfortante».

Le fait que Dieu soit une Sainte=Mère au lieu d'un Saint-Père ne me dérange pas, elle est tout ce que j'espérais et même plus encore».
Ces déclarations ont provoqué l’émoi dans le clergé catholique de l'archidiocèse, obligeant le cardinal Sean P. O’Malley  à faire une déclaration publique, pour expliquer que Dieu n’était pas une femme et que le père O’neal avait subi des hallucinations.
{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 781, 'Headline': 'KC Man Does Not Have Ebola'} | discuss | unrelated | Turkey's president has said it was wrong for the United States to deliver military supplies to Kurdish fighters defending the Syrian city of Kobane after some of the weapons ended up in ISIS' hands.

The Pentagon claims the vast majority of the U.S. supplies dropped over the weekend had reached the Kurdish fighters despite an online video showing jihadists in possession of a bundle.

Tayyip Erdogan today said the mission had been a mistake - adding that he could not understand why the U.S. was so keen to defend Kobane as there were no longer any citizens in the city.

The weapons drop had been considered a highly sensitive subject for Turkey, who says the Kurdish fighter provided with American weapons are linked to the Kurdish People’s Protection Unit (YPG) – a group Ankara considers to be a terrorist organisation.

Error: Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan said it was wrong for the United States to deliver military supplies to Kurdish fighters defending the Syrian city of Kobane after some of the weapons ended up in ISIS' hands

A still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey border

Speaking at a news conference in Ankara today, Erdogan described the weapons drop as a mistake.

'What was done here on this subject turned out to be wrong. Why did it turn out wrong? Because some of the weapons they dropped from those C130s were seized by ISIL,’ he said, using an alternative acronym for ISIS.

Asked about a plan for Turkey to facilitate the passage of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighters to Kobane to help in its defence, Erdogan said he proposed this move in a telephone call with Barack Obama at the weekend.

'I have difficulty understanding why KobanE is so strategic for them because there are no civilians there, just around 2,000 fighters,' Erdogan said.

'At first they didn't say yes to peshmergas, but then they gave a partial yes and we said we would help.'

He added that talks were continuing among officials on the details of the peshmergas' transit through Turkey.

One Turkish journalist close to the government said on Wednesday some 500 of them were expected to cross into Kobani this weekend

A U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said

Earlier, the US Defense Department said is investigating video footage appearing to show Islamic State fanatics with at least one cache of weapons airdropped by coalition forces that was meant for Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

Yesterday ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.'

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss.

The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.

Macaulay Culkin has been the victim of a death hoax - again.

For the second time this year the actor has had false reports circulate online regarding his sudden death.

But once again it turns out that the Home Alone star is actually alive and well.

{'Stance': 'unrelated', 'Body ID': 158, 'Headline': 'Robert Plant Reportedly Tears Up $800 Million Led Zeppelin Reunion Contract'} | discuss | unrelated | Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.

The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.

Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.

The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.

The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.

Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.

Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.

The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.

Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.

Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.

This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.

In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.

In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning.
